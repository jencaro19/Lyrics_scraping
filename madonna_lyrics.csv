0,live to tell,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36050507/Madonna/Live+to+Tell,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me"
1,holiday,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36111222/Madonna/Holiday,"Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate

If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together to release the pressure
We need a holiday

If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate (come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice

You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate
Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together, we can make things better
We need a holiday

If we took a holiday (holiday)
Took some time to celebrate (celebrate)
Just one day out of life (just one day)
It would be, it would be so nice

Holiday

2,like a virgin,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36111174/Madonna/Like+a+Virgin,"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Hoo, Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Like a virgin, ooh ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me,
And your heart beats,
And you love me

Oh oh, ooh whoa
Oh oh oh whoa
Whoa oh ho, ho

Ooh baby
Yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?"
3,soltera,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36233895/Madonna/Soltera,"Ah, Maluma (Ese soy yo)
It's um Madonna (Mamacita) that's right!

Quiere estar soltera
Nadie la enamora
Por que está tan buena
Que prefiere estar sola que mal acompañada

Ella es así nadie la va a cambiar
Es reservada no da el celular
A ningún hombre le piensa copiar
Ella anda suelta y no le va a bajar

I told you not to waste your time
I'm not a girl you drink like wine
If you press pause then I'll retreat
I will not grovel at your feet
Please don't fall in love with me
I would rather be set free
I can not give you my all
I will not make my self small
For no one

Anybody, body, body
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body
En el party, party, party
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body

Quiere estar soltera
Nadie la enamora
Por que está tan buena
Que prefiere estar sola que mal acompañada

Ella es así nadie la va a cambiar
Es reservada no da el celular
A ningún hombre le piensa copiar
Ella anda suelta y no le va a bajar

Don't you try to rescue me
I'm who I'll always be
And I rather be alone
Than pretend to make a perfect doll

I told you not to waste your time
I'm not a girl you drink like wine
If you press pause then I'll retreat
I will not grovel at your feet, so

Anybody, body, body
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body
En el party, party, party
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body

Se mueve pa' arriba, pa'l centro, pa' dentro
Mueve caderas, que me tiene enfermo
Tú sabes muy bien cual es el movimiento
Dale pa' aca, pa' aca, pa' aca
Entre más te acercas más rico te siento
Sube las manos y mueve tu cuerpo
Tú sabes bien cual es el movimiento
Dale pa' atra' pa atra, pa' atra'

And don't you forget it ciao papi
And don't you forget it ciao papi
You are going to regret it
Yeah ciao papi
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
Ciao papi"

Far from what can help
Far from where it's safe
Hope it's not too late
Rush, rush, rush on you
Love, love, loved on you
Loved you like a fool
Put my trust in you

'Cause you're the one I crave
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade
I don't think we should play with this
Said come, come give me strength
I don't think we should wait for this

And my cravings get dangerous

Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous
Ooh, I don't think we should play with this
Ooh (ooh), my cravings get dangerous

Something real (yeah), something I can feel
You know I just can't change, this is how I'm made
I'm not afraid, take me to that place

You're only one pull up away (away)
You're down to ride, you ride me like a wave (ride, yeah)
I gave you a sensation (ooh)
A loner, days we used to chase
It's do or die, yeah, my love life can get crazy (crazy)
It's on the line, girl, you're risking everything (thing)
It's over-X-rated

Ran so far to try to find the thing I lacked and there it was
Inside (side) of (of) me (me)
Ran and ran and ran so fast, a thing to last, and there it was
I hear (hear) you (you) breathe (breathe)

'Cause you're the one I crave (crave)
And my cravings get dangerous
The feelings never fade

5,dark ballet,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36278799/Madonna/Dark+Ballet,"It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is
'Cause your world is
Up in flames

It's a beautiful plan (hmm), but I'm not concerned (oh yeah)
It's a beautiful game (hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (shut your mouth)
That I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is
'Cause your world is

I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounc﻿e my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
I am not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe you
God is on my side and I'll be fine
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie, the wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life"

8,like a prayer,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36341851/Madonna/Like+a+Prayer,"Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there, just like a prayer"

Put a record on
I want to dance with my baby

Put a record on
I want to dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never want to stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music

[Chorus]
Music makes the people come together
[Never gonna stop]
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Never gonna stop]

Don't think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie, uh, uh
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday

Hey Mister D.J.

I want to dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never want to stop

I took a pill and had a dream (Yo también)
I went back to my 17 year
Allowed myself to be naive (Dime)
To be someone I've never been (Me encanta)
I took a sip and had a dream
And I woke up in Medellín (¿Te gusta?)
The sun was caressing my skin (Dime)
Another me could now begin (Woo)

Tranquila, baby, yo te apoyo
No hay que hablarnos mucho para entrar en rollo
Si quieres ser mi reina pues yo te corono
Y pa' que te sientes aquí tengo un trono
Te gusta cabalgar, eso está claro
Si sientes que voy rápido le bajo
Discúlpame, yo sé que eres Madonna
Pero te voy a demostrar cómo este perro te enamora

Our nation lied, we lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don't have a chance
To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh
I think I understand why people get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence, spread everywhere
They say that we need love
But we need more than this

We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control

This is your wake-up call
I'm like your nightmare
I'm here to start your day
This is your wake-up call

A new democracy
God and pornography
A new democracy

People think that I'm insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
That's why I don't smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside, my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I don't smoke, it's true

Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth (wake up)

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up
Make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up
It's a hustle, yeah
It's a hustle
It's a con
It's a hustle
It's a weird kind of energy
A bizarre thing that happens to be
An abnormal fraternity
And I feel more than sympathy

We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up
Make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

A new democracy!

It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I'm misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of room, you tryna make good

But if you think I've been foolish and you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now if you think I've been foolish and you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're drivin' me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão louca
Você não vai me por tão louca

I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force that I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

But if you think I've been foolish and you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now if you think I've been foolish and you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're drivin' me crazy
You must think I'm crazy

Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão louca
Você não vai me por tão louca

Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the war (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Paid the hell you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name (forget your name)

But if you think I've been foolish and you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now if you think I've been foolish and you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're drivin' me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca (louca)
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy (crazy)
Você não vai me por tão louca
Você não vai me por tão louca (louca)

'Cause you're drivin' me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me por tão louca
Você não vai me por tão louca"

Bitch, I'm loca (y yo loco, loco)
Bésame la boca (¿y tú qué me das?)
Bitch, me gusta (y yo te provoco)
Mucho que me asusta (por eso no te vas)

Llegó a la disco montando
Terror con sus amigas
es lo que le gusta
Ella es la reina de su combo y nada la intimida
Es que es la más dura

Solo utiliza Chanel
Qué lo bien lo combina con su joya Cartier
Dicen que su exnovio la dejó por infiel
Le gustan menores como yo, se le ve

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene

Bitch, I'm loca (y yo loco, loco)
Bésame la boca (¿Yytú qué me das?) (Ay)
Bitch, me gusta (y yo te provoco)
Mucho que me asusta (por eso no te vas)

Quiero ser tu perra, también tu bebecita
Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita
I like to be on top, ver cómo te excitas (bye bye bye)
Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita (hey, hey, hey, hey!)

Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca
Ella es mi loca, loca y yo soy loco, loco
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca
Pero si me pide yo soy loco, loco

You may be young and hot
I'm not so sure that you can manage this type of entertainment
I've had a Latin boy and truth, there was a bit of damage
Somehow, I think you like that
Let's see if you can last
Forget about the future and we have no past
I like the way you move, you know you're just my type
I guess you like a crazy girl, but it's alright

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene, yeah yeah

Bitch, I'm loca (y yo loco, loco, loco) (tranquila)
Besame la boca (¿Y tú qué me das?) (Venga, baby)
Bitch, me gusta (y yo te provoco)
Mucho que me asusta (por eso no te vas) (ay, ay, papi)

Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca (ay)
Ella es mi loca, loca y yo soy loco, loco (ay, ay, papi)
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca (lo-lo-loca)
Pero si me pide yo soy loco, loco (ay, ay, papi)
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca (ay)
Ella es mi loca, loca y yo soy loco, loco (ay, ay, papi)
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca (lo-lo-loca)

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me want to hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key

Open your heart, I'll make you love me (C'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (I'm gonna give it to you)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, c'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, c'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (I'm gonna give it to you)

For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy what will it be

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Bridge:

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

[Chorus:]

Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I now you're mine

You've got to

Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine

This I know 'cause it's

True love

I've cried oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

Wonder what love was all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said

""Come on get up, get your hands up!""
Yeah, that's it, a nice gold medal for the copper
Only maybe he's gonna get it sooner than he thinks!

[I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

[Chorus:]

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

[Chorus:]

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

I hope you find what you're looking for

Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie, I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

That's when I can have fun

Time to come undone

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul

Couldn't wait to get older
Thought I'd have so much fun
Guess I'm one of the grown-ups
Now I have to get the job done
People give me the business
I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos
Gotta get away from here

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down

Slow down you move too fast

Gonna let my hair hang down

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter

Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan

This time I'm not only getting
I'm holding my man"
26,fever,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35736994/Madonna/Fever,"You give me
You give me fever

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

[Chorus:]
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

[Chorus:]

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

You give me fever, fever
You give me, you give me fever

[Chorus:]

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby, you're my flame
He gave her fever

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

[Chorus:]

Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, daddy oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right

Fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn (repeat twice)"
27,bad girl,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35736995/Madonna/Bad+Girl,"Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

This way

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

I'm not happy this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy
This way

I'm not happy this way
Kissing some kind stranger's lips"
28,bye bye baby,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35736992/Madonna/Bye+Bye+Baby,"This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me
You're thinking of me
But we're never together

[Chorus:]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

[Chorus:]

You're so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say bye bye

[Chorus:]

I don't want to keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowin' in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adios

Uh, this is not a love song
I'd like to hurt you

What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

The first time and the last time
You can forget about it baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it baby, bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
You fucked it up"

This masquerade is getting older
Light are low, the curtains down
There's no one here (There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around (No one around)
Watching you, watching me,
One lonely star (One lonely star you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile,
All the world loves a clown (Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played (Role that you played)
No more masquerade,
You're one lonely star (One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye

All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you (I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah, I'm crazy for you

I'm not a baby

I need your help, daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please

Papa don't preach I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, hm
I'm gonna keep my baby, hm

He says that he's going to marry me
We can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now is some good advice, please

Papa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby, hm
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh ooh

Have to let them be

I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

35,la isla bonita,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35459774/Madonna/La+Isla+Bonita,"Como puede ser verdad

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama"
36,oh what a circus,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34817641/Madonna/Oh+What+a+Circus,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina peron
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention
Unless we all are, I think we all are
So share my glory, so share my coffin
So share my glory, so share my coffin

It's our funeral too"

This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all
You believed in me, I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do? For our dream to survive?
How do we keep, all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me"

Let's make it obvious

Eyes, hair, mouth, figure
Dress, voice, style, movement
Hands, magic, rings, glamour
Face, diamonds, excitement, image

So christian dior me from my head to my toes
I need to be dazzling, I want to be rainbow high
They must have excitement, and so must I

They need their escape, and so do I

All my descamisados expect me to outshine the enemy
I won't disappoint them
I'm their savior, that's what they call me
So Lauren Bacall me, anything goes
To make me fantastic, I have to be rainbow high
In magical colors

You're not decorating a girl for a night on the town
And I'm not a second-rate queen getting kicks with a crown

Next stop will be Europe
The rainbow's gonna tour, dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show

Look out, mighty Europe
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of
Just a little touch of
Argentina's brand of star quality"

You pay with sweat and tears, and overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star

41,devil pray,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34385933/Madonna/Devil+Pray,"Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

I've been swimming in the ocean
""Til I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide 
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

Oh, save my 
Oh, save my 
Oh, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Oh, save my
Oh, save my 
Oh, save my 
Devil's here to fool ya

Oh, save my

Devil's here to fool ya

Oh, save my 
Oh, save my
Oh, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary can't you help me
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide 
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

Oh, sing hallelujah
Oh, save my soul
Oh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said oh, sing hallelujah
Oh, save my soul
Oh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told 

Until my story's told"

So pop the hood and see what's good I need to a toolin' man
My precious love I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thumpin' on the lot

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

Stuck to the seat our body heat, what will you do with those ice
This should get outta here, was steppin' on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're gone past, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

I'll work on the engine
Like we blew a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die it's true

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

I hear you work in a body shop"

You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune

You sad I was over wanted it to end
Than you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak city
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
You never gained the best of me
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me
'Cause I'm in heartbreak city

You tore me into pieces
You didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess

I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You sad I was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets

Built me up and I can do no wrong

I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache I'm gonna carry on

Living for love

I'm not giving up

But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you

You've broken my heart, but you can't bring it down
I've fallen apart, I was lost, now I'm found
I picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble

45,rebel heart,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34385921/Madonna/Rebel+Heart,"I live my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say ""told you so, told you so""
Why can't you be like the other girls
I said, oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me
All of the things I did, just to be seen"

It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child

You pay with sweat and tears, and overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star

Born to be, meant to be

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how

Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Hoo, Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Like a virgin, ooh ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me,
And your heart beats,
And you love me

Oh oh, ooh whoa
Oh oh oh whoa
Whoa oh ho, ho

Ooh baby
Yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?"

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call 
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring ring ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me
Cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it will be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do

I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)

Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend
Everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy
That's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby
Time to come undone

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control

Couldn't wait to get older
Thought I'd have so much fun
Guess I'm one of the grown-ups
Now I have to get the job done
People give me the business
I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos
Gotta get away from here

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how, I'm ready now

Slow down you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

Where's the party
Where's the party, someone tell me
Where's the party, come on, come on, come on

To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away

Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would

Keep people together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I want to be different, I want to be on my own
But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting something back
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

Keep, keep it together forever, keep it together
Keep people together forever, together

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun

That by sheer force of will
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear
And surrender to me
To love

Show your sister how
Love your brother now
Show your sister"
68,in this life,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35470128/Madonna/In+This+Life,"Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

What for?
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

Have you ever watched your best friend die [what for]
Have you ever watched a grown man cry [what for]
Some say that life isn't fair [what for]
I say that people just don't care [what for]
They'd rather turn the other way [what for]
And wait for this thing to go away [what for]
Why do we have to pretend [what for]
Some day I pray it will end

I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time"
69,i'm going bananas,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35470124/Madonna/I%27m+Going+Bananas,"Hola! Ese bato loco!

I'm going bananas,
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas,
For I'm going bananas.

I'm non compos mentes,
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,
For I'm non compos mentes.

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat,
That makes me gonzo.
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas
For I'm going bananas.

I'm going meshuga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing ""Booga wooga"",
But I'm going meshuga.

There's bats in my belfry.
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight,
Otherwise I might get myself free.
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.

Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think,
That makes me gonzo.
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas,
Someone get me a bed in the ""Casa de Loco"" for all my mananas,
For I'm going bananas.
Yes, I'm going bananas.
Si, I'm going bananas."
70,waiting for tonight,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33451917/Madonna/Waiting+for+Tonight,"Like a movie scene in the sweetest dreams
I had pictured us together
Now to feel your lips on my fingertips
I have to say is even better

Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever

I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight"
71,sooner or later ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524467/Madonna/Sooner+or+Later+%5BFrom+Dick+Tracy%5D,"Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter

Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan

This time I'm not only getting
I'm holding my man"

I wanna hold your hand in Rome

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

I want to know you, not like that
I don't wanna be your mother
I don't wanna be your sister either
I just wanna be your lover
I wanna be your baby, kiss me, that's right, kiss me

Wanting, needing, waiting

Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams, am I in them?
Tell me your fears, are you scared?
Tell me your stories, I'm not afraid of who you are, we can fly

Poor is the man whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I wanna be your baby, yeah

Wanting, needing, waiting

74,hold tight,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31699009/Madonna/Hold+Tight,"A million miles later
We walk through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised but our hearts will guide us
Together I know no one else is gonna last forever
You're gonna be alright, tonight

We live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane

Together, we're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

A million miles later
We walk through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised but our hearts will guide us
Together I know no one else is gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright, tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
Wanna be the one that's bleeding

Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright

75,joan of arc,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31699008/Madonna/Joan+of+Arc,"Each time they take a photograph
I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide, this is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
I never admit it
But it hurts

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be war but I'm not going down

One little lie I can ruin my day
Words are like weapons they betray
When I am afraid, one word of kindness it can save me

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be war but I'm not going down

Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day I won't care
But for the moment I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes, and let you catch me now

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, oh yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be war but I'm not going down

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now

Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break

You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

Ah, Ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah, Ah
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover
Let's just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on

This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

Ah, Ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhh
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover
Let's just hold
Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

I know we're alright
'Cause we'll never be alone
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world
Even with no light
We're gonna shine like gold
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

When the world gets cold
I'll be your cover

Onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When it all falls, when it all falls down

77,unapologetic b****,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31819782/Madonna/Unapologetic+B%2A%2A%2A%2A,"Woke up this morning feeling that you were gone
I thought awhile, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it
Then you let it go
See you tryin' to call me, but I blocked you on the phone
It took a minute, but now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you sayin' that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
You know you never really knew how much you loved me 'til you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, f*ck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

I know you'd like it if I stayed home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, did it, loved it, hated it
I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
You know you never really knew how much you loved me 'til you lost me
Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, f*ck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

Yeah yeah yeah woah
Yeah yeah yeah woah
Yeah yeah yeah woah
Yeah yeah yeah woah

It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

You know you never really knew how much you loved me, till you lost me?
Did you?
You know you never knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me?
Well, f*ck you

It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope or Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not trying to s-stack for cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on a golden cat

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets inside
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)

It's the enlightenment that started it all
The founding fathers wrote it down on a wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turn right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

Behind the curtain of the new world order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the phoenix, pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not Google of the United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Ban
Or anyone you love to hate

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets inside
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)

You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
Come on, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight (tonight, to-tonight, tonight, tonight)

It's like
It's like
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)

It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)

You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
And I'm no longer needed

You sad I was over wanted it to end
Than you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak city
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
You never gained the best of me
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me
'Cause I'm in heartbreak city

You tore me into pieces
You didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess

I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You sad I was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets

Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation right within

An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this crazy ex where has stand where I fall

I don't lie, not trying to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Jump between the impulses, 
Stay or running away from all this madness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like a tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You can fled a needle with the cheer of from my eyes
It should injustice to be with this, two of things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me

From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like a tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me"
84,best night,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31799411/Madonna/Best+Night,"You can call me M tonight
You can be my man tonight
It's gonna be like this, that's right
Give you love that you'll never forget

The city is our playground tonight
We're gonna be like gangsters tonight
We don't give a damn if it's wrong or right
Lighten up, we won't have no regrets

I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Lose your self-control, we can go wild
Show you what it means to feel alive
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

We don't have to speak that much
I hear you when I feel your touch
Whisper in my ears, make me blush
Feel the chill as we kiss, don't forget

All you had as dreams, don't hold back
All the fantasies you ever had
Just do what you like, go ahead
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets

I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Lose your self-control, we can go wild
Show you what it means to feel alive
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Surrender to the pleasure (wanting)
When we breath in together (waiting)
It's either now or never (for you)
This feeling will take over

No sex tapes, no camera (wanting)
Just you and me together (waiting)
Repeat it like a mantra (for you)
I'm in love, I'm in love

85,veni vidi vici,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31799410/Madonna/Veni+Vidi+Vici,"Life was so crazy
You've been through a lot
I tell you stories some times you know

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize, my every single move
But then I realized, I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise, when I became the news

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark

I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

(Talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say your little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a f*ck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two 
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybpdy
And trapster, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messaiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

I conquered
I conquered
I conquered"

Leave you a blanket of silver and gold
I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told

I need your strength, it will keep me from harm
I'll be your queen, safe in your arms
Don't want to get to the end of my days
Saying I wasn't amazed

Changing me's like shooting in the dark
Patience please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to
Believe me I want it just as bad
Forgive me, wish I could change the past
Take it 'cause I'll never be as perfect as you want

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars

I love you the way that you are

Don't judge me, just gotta let me be
Accept me, although I'm incomplete
My imperfections make me unique that's my belief

I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws

I love you the way that you are

Anything is possible
Always been a rebel
Overcoming obstacles
I can't give you perfect
But I can give you forever, oh ohoh

Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with a fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist
Put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil
Watch you slither away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted, I'm, I'm addicted to the one that got away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark

Why can't you be like the other girls
I said, oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me
All of the things I did, just to be seen"

You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up and I can do no wrong

I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down

Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache I'm gonna carry on

I picked up my crown, put it back on my head

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Boo doo bee doo

Santa honey, I wanna yacht and really that's
Not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, there's one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking with a duplex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Boo doo bee doo

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean a phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight"
99,girl gone wild,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28777646/Madonna/Girl+Gone+Wild,"Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell
But most of all because I love Thee,
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But i'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild"

Hey Britney, are you ready, uh-huh, are you?

When no one cares
It's whipping my hair
It's pulling my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is dripping all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancing up in this place
Tonight I'm here
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass

I want to get stupid
Trying to take my music

Bang ,
The shooter name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed 'shoot again'
I gave her extra rounds
My barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down
I leave hearts on the ground
My love is a weapon
And yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shell
I never shoot and tell
I only shoot to kill
And that vest ain't gonna help ya
Even if it's made of steel

Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell

Bang bang
Bang bang

I thought you were good
But you painted me bad
Compared to the others
You're the best thing I had

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

I thought it was you
And I loved you the most
But I was just keeping
My enemies close

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all my jack?

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead in the head

Bitch out of order
Bat out of hell
Fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all my jack?

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, shot you dead

Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead and I have no regrets
Bang bang, shot you dead in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head

And then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You were building my coffin
You were driving my hearse

Bang bang, shot you dead
Bang bang, in the head

I thought it was you
And I loved you the most
But I was just keeping
My enemies close

I made a decision,
I would never look back
So how did you end up
With all of my jack?

Bang bang, shot you dead, in the head

Bang bang, shot you dead, in the head

You have to die for me baby
That's right, you have to die for me baby
How could I move on with my life
If you didn't die for me baby
If you didn't die for me baby
I need you to die for me baby

Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Bang bang, shot you dead, shot my lover in the head
Now my lover is dead, and I have no regrets
He deserved it

And I'm going straight to hell
And I've got a lot of friends there
And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
'Cause I wanna see him die
Over and over
And over
And over
And over
And over
And over
And over

Now drive bitch
I said drive bitch
And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right drive bitch

Now drive bitch
I said drive bitch
And while you're at it, die bitch
That's right drive bitch

Now if you're gonna act like a bitch
Then you're gonna die like a bitch"

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call 
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring ring ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me
Cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it will be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do

Waiting for your call
Baby night and day

This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the WIFI
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweetin on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

You were so mad at me
Whos got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didnt have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers:
""Baby Jesus"" on the stairs
Gotta sign the contract
Gotta get my money back
All the biters have to go
Standing in the front row

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right

I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself
And I swallowed my light
I tried to become all
That you expect of me
And if it was a failure
I don't give a

Shots fire
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire
You don't hear them bums on nothin' that's fire
Tell 'em, ""catch buyer""
In the Bugatti: ten grand, one tire
Aye yo, Madonna, (Yes, Nicki) maybe I say you more original don gaga
In that, yeah Gabbana, and the, ah yeah, Prada
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a ""F"" you
Curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you
Yo, I ain't a businesswoman
I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

107,turn up the radio,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946756/Madonna/Turn+Up+the+Radio,"When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane

There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams

I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
'Cause I don't want to say where I'm going

Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice cause the temperatures pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you

I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun it it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

Just let me turn up the radio

You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move
It seems to me is what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seem to me is what you're like
The ""look but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible"
109,justify my love ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946753/Madonna/Justify+My+Love+%28Video+Interlude%29,"Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near

He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works, I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men

But have tested those who call themselves apostles
But are not and found them to be false
I know that you are enduring patiently
And bearing out for my namesake

And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned the love you had

I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews but they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping, praying for you to justify my love

And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bears

And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne, and great authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshiped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshiped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""

And the beast was given a
Mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against God

It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain

If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping

Then, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them and they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them

He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For these things will have passed away

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone""

And he said to me, he said to me
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near, let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy""

""Behold, I am coming soon
I am the alpha and the omega
The first and the last
The beginning and the end""

Amen
What are you gonna do?"

111,love spent,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946748/Madonna/Love+Spent,"You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you have married me if I were poor
Yes, if I was your treasury
You’d have found a time to treasure me

How come you can’t see
All that you need
Is right here with me

Up until the end
All this pretend
Wasn’t for free

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me
Now you have your money
Spend it til there’s nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

If we opened up a joint account
Would it put an end to all your doubt
Frankly if my name was Benjamin
We wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in

You played with my heart
Till death do we part
That’s what you said
Now you have your fast cars
Women and bars
It’s gone to your head

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me
Love me like your money
Spend it til there’s nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold on to it
Till there’s nothing left

Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah I’m love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms
Until there’s nothing left (nothing left, nothing left)

Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah I’m love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms
Until there’s nothing left (nothing left, nothing left)"

Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died

I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like-like you know me, like-like-like

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup, and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
(It's no fun but the damage is done) Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like, like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me

Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch TV)

113,i'm addicted,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946746/Madonna/I%27m+Addicted,"When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can’t get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I’d write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

Feels like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love
(I’m addicted to your love)
(I’m addicted to your love)

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It’s like MDMA and that’s OK

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don’t care if you think that I’m strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I’m ready to take this chance
I need to dance

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

MDMA, MDMA, MDMA, MDMA (I’m addicted)

Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
(Think about it)
Doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Feel my temperature rising
It's too much heat
I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher?
Get closer to the fire
I don't what you're waiting for

[Chorus]
I'm gonna party 
(Yeah)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(Yeah)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you got a reputation 
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show ya
That if it feels right
Get on your mark
Step to the beat boy
That's what its for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside 
But for now just come here
Let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

I'm gonna party 
(It's a celebration)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(No more hesitation)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance?
Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on
What are you waiting for?

I'm gonna party 
(It's a celebration)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(No more hesitation)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Come join the party

'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

For every sin, I'll have to pay
A time to work, a time to play
I think I'll find another way

And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell
But most of all because I love Thee,
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But i'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun

123,in america ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/29144646/Madonna/In+America+%5BPerformance+Track+with+Demonstration+Vocals%5D+%5BIn+the+Style,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken

124,beautiful killer,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35446707/Madonna/Beautiful+Killer,"Dark eyes on a dangerous face you are a beautiful killer
We pass by the same old place you are a (beautiful killer)
You don’t have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I don’t understand
I don’t know much about you are a wanted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a (beautiful killer)
I like your silhouette when you stand on the streets
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
'Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

(Beautiful killer)

You changed the past
Good guys always finish last
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
'Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

You’re a beautiful killer, but you’ll never be Alain Delon"
125,best friend,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35446706/Madonna/Best+Friend,"I miss your brain
The way you think
But I don't miss
The way you used to drink

I miss our talks
The Universal Law
You had a way
Of seeing through my thoughts

It's so confusing I thought I met my match
An intellectual would telling for a catch
You always said we be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regret
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the country side where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times, I don't miss all of it

You wrote me poetry
You had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forever more

Still I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived all biggest tests
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that had to end
I lost my very best friend (lost my very best friend)
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend

I put away your letter
Saved the best ones that I have
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

Still I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

Yet I have no regrets
'Cause  I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end"

Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, that’s what you are

I’m your biggest fan, it’s true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the password to my phone
I’ll give you a massage when you get home

Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, that’s what you are

You're Bruce Lee with the way that you move
You're Travolta getting into your groove
You're James Dean driving in your fast car
You're a hot track, you're my suppa duppa star

You're my superstar
You're my superstar (Ooh la la, ooh la la)
You're my superstar (Ooh la la, ooh ooh ooh ooh la la)

I’m your biggest fan, it’s true
Hopelessly attracted to you
You can have the keys to my car
I'll play you a song on my guitar

Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
Ooh la la, you’re my superstar
Ooh la la, that’s what you are

Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, you're my superstar
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, you're my supersuperstar"
130,i f**ked up,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27943251/Madonna/I+F%2A%2Aked+Up,"I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept my big mouth closed
I could have just done what I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you
I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
Do you wanna know how to make out loud
Telling your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Fill it up with Warhols
It would be so cool
Coulda gone buyin' estates in the countryside
With a pack of great things
Kissing eye to eye
We coulda do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We coulda found a mountain seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda got a building built on the echo run
We coulda got ourselves arrested and sold our mum
We coulda live like crazy til' the day we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Je suis desole
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back,
Maybe one day,
Or not"
131,falling free,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26230688/Madonna/Falling+Free,"When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I’d kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure so sure I’d struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark

See our hearts are intertwined
Then I’m free, free of mine
I’m falling free

And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love

And when you lift you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over Hope and Love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again

When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, free to go
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go"

It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

We've got to take a stand (Love makes the world go round)
Love makes the world go round
(If you don't hear the sound) Love makes the world go round)

Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round

Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round

136,la isla bonita ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964714/Madonna/La+Isla+Bonita+%5BExtended+Remix%5D,"Como puede ser verdad
 
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama"

Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Oh no baby my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Don't go givin' me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run seem to have all the fun
But are you wasting my time -- she's so fine
Are you just being kind

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
That's how I feel, don't fog my mind

Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
That this is not a love song that I want to sing"
138,till death do us part,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964710/Madonna/Till+Death+Do+Us+Part,"Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't,
'Cause you don't love me no more

You need so much but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that, she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is true, when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay, here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that, she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is true when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

She's had enough, she says the end
But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again
Till death do us part"
139,promise to try,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964709/Madonna/Promise+to+Try,"Little girl don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try, it's not the same

Keep your head held high, ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss, kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try, but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on, but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye, but I promise to try"

Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic lantern
He will make your dreams come true for you

Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons, for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade"

Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling, I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand; at least he was a man

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?"

I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace
To confess my sins, to do penance, to amend my life,
And to avoid the temptations of evil.

Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion"

Things can't get any worse
Night is getting colder  sometimes
Life feels like it's a curse
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't want to carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Children killing children while the
Students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't want to carry anymore
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Let the water wash over you
Wash all over you
Swim to the ocean floor
So that we can begin again
Wash away all our sins
Crash to the other shore
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't want to carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't want to carry anymore
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor"

Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light I'm flying"

Did I lie to you?

Magic poison
You're a candy perfume boy

Magic poison
It's candy
It's candy
I'm your candy perfume girl,
I'm your candy perfume girl

Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?

(Put your hand on my skin)

Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to make a connection
I'm walking on a thin line
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?

Touch me, I'm trying
To see inside of your soul
I've got this thing
I want to make a correction
I'm not like this all the time
You've got this thing
You've got this thing

Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say

Kiss me, I'm dying (Kiss me, I'm dying)
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to have your protection (protection, protection)
I close my eyes
I close your eyes

148,nothing really matters,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964697/Madonna/Nothing+Really+Matters,"When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one

Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one

I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light

You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you (Everything I give you)
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need"
149,sky fits heaven,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964696/Madonna/Sky+Fits+Heaven,"Sky fits heaven so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

Fate fits karma so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go

Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

Hand fits giving so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as they go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as I go

Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go"

How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mm, if I could melt your heart
Mm, we'd never be apart
Mm, give yourself to me
Mm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mm, if I could melt your heart
Mm, we'd never be apart
Mm, give yourself to me

The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do ya wanna go higher?

There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good bye

Your heart is not open so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good bye

Learn to say good bye
I yearn to say good bye

There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good bye

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise

So hot, yet so cold
My heart is in your hand
And yet you never stand
Close enough for me to have my way

To love but not to keep
To laugh, not to weep
Your eyes, they go right through
And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay

Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told
You're to have, not to hold

To look but not to see
To kiss but never be
The object of your desire
I'm walking on a wire
And there's no one at all
To break my fall

Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you

155,mer girl,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964690/Madonna/Mer+Girl,"I ran from my house
That cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me
Even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops
I ran to the sky
Out to the lake
Into the rain
That matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and ran
I was looking for me
I ran past the churches
And the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards
And the lady that never talks
Up into the hills
I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath
And thought about your death
I ran to the lake
Up into the hills
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All the forgotten names
I tasted the rain
I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels
I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
The black sky opened up
Blinding me

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran
I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes
And up to the hill
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I smelt her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay

I ran and I ran
I'm still running away"

Comets shoot across the sky

Galaxies are sliding into view

You didn't understand or care to know
You get your education from your lovers
But now there's just no place for you to go

It doesn't pay
To be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay
To give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

You're set adrift with no direction
Just like a ship that's lost at sea
You don't care where you drop your anchor
Make sure it doesn't land on me

'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do

Uh uh no away

To be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay
To give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled

There's nothing to forget
All the pain was worth it

Not running from the past
I tried to do what's best
I know that I deserve it

And it's tearing me apart

Wear shirts and boots 'cause it's okay to be a boy

'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like wouldn't you
What it feels like for a girl

Silky
Smooth lips as sweet as candy
Baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls
They never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak could you be a little weak

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl

Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently
Baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show and tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best could you be a little less

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls
They never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak could you be a little weak

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl

You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
(I've listened to your stories)
You're not half the man you'd like to be

I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
We stayed because I made it so convenient
Don't explain yourself you'll never see

Gomen nasai
Mujhe maaf kardo
przepraszam
Slihah
Forgive me

Sorry

I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before

I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap
(I don't wanna hear)
(I don't wanna know )
(Please don't say you're sorry)
There's more important things than hearing you speak
(I've heard it all before)
(And I can take care of myself)
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'

(I've heard it all before)

167,future lovers,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964678/Madonna/Future+Lovers,"Spoken:
I'm gonna tell you about love
Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills, and loans
Come with me
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance

Spoken:
In the demonstration of this evidence
Some call it religion
This is not a coincidence
Would you like to try?
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride
Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Let me be your guide
Put aside your pride
Future lovers hide love inside their eyes
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
Love controlled by time
Future lovers shine for eternity
In a world that's free
Put away your past
That will never last
If you're holding on to a dream that's gone
I'm gonna tell you about love
Would you like to try?
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
In the evidence of its brilliance
There's no love like the future love
Come with me

Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride, Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride, Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?
(In the evidence of its brilliance) (repeat)
Connect to the sky
Future lovers ride, Their ambitions high
Would you like to try?

Brilliance?
Brilliance?
Brilliance?

But I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork

Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby you can keep

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York
I love New York
I love New York

If you don't like my attitude
Then you can F off
Just go to Texas
Isn't that where they golf?

New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat
Then get off my street
Get off of my street
Get off my street
You get off of my street
Get off my street
You get off of my street
Get off my street

Other places always make me sad

Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture

There was a boy
And there was a girl

Just one touch from your hands

Forbidden love
Are we supposed to be together
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
Forbidden love
We seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love

Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain

Once upon a time
There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world

The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
All work and no fighting, I'll find a place of my own

Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby,
Yes, I'm ready to jump
Just take my hands
Get ready to jump

We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
And life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

Are you ready to jump?
Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump

How much fortune can you make?

I spent my whole life
Wanting to be talked about
I did it

To see my name in lights

Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserved it

How high are the stakes?

Does this get any better?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?

How everybody mentions my name
But they're never very nice
I took it
Just about everything
Except my own advice

Was it all worth it?
How did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserved it

Or you can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden
You'll be the snake
All of my fruits
Is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because
This is who I am
You can like it or not
You can love me
Or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No no

Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox
And it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the femme without the fatale
Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot
Under the vine
Fill up your cup
And let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow

176,american pie,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28998331/Madonna/American+Pie,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

We can take it anywhere

Physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
Sweet satisfaction

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door, out the door

Physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction

Physical attraction
So much satisfaction, attraction, reaction
So much satisfaction
It's a physical, a physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
Physical, physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
A physical, a physical attraction"

Yeah I've been watching you
Yeah I know you want to get up
Yeah come on

Everybody come on dance and sing
Everybody get up and do your thing
Everybody come on dance and sing

Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say

Come on take a chance
Get up and start to dance
Let the D.J. shake you
Let the music take you

Everybody come on dance and sing
Everybody get up and do your thing
Everybody come on dance and sing
Everybody get up and do your thing

Let your body take a ride
Feel the beat and step inside
Music makes the world go 'round
You can turn you troubles upside down

Gonna have to change your mind
Gonna leave your troubles behind
Your body gets the notion
When your feet can make the motion

Everybody come on dance and sing
Everybody get up and do your thing
Everybody come on dance and sing

183,angel,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022442/Madonna/Angel,"Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel baby

Clouds just disappear"

Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

You're the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away (away)
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
No no don't, don't live live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
No it don't live here anymore

He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

It was so strange the way he held my hand
I wanted more than just a one night stand
He had a way of making me believe
That he was mine and that he'd never leave

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why
He's a pretender
He's a pretender

I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind, I know all about your kind

He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, that fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

I like the way he moved across the floor
And when he danced with me I know he wanted more
But in the dark things happened much too fast
I should've stopped him then, I knew it wouldn't last

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why

I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind

He's a pretender, he knows just what to say
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day

Do you still feel the same way that you did before?
Did you come to bring me sorrow?
Like all those wasted days
Let's not think about tomorrow

You can stay
Am I just dreaming or did you say you have to go?
If you can't stay forever, I don't want to know
There's no need to talk about it
The way things used to be
I'm not living here without you

Won't you stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'
Won't you stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'

Erotica, romance
My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it
If I'm in charge and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

I'd like to put you in a trance, all over
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain
I can see you understand
I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

I'd like to put you in a trance, all over

Put your hands all over my body

I don't think you know what pain is
I don't think you've gone that way
I could bring you so much pleasure
I'll come to you when you say
I know you want me
I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm not gonna hurt you, just close your eyes

Erotic, erotic
Erotic, erotic (just close your eyes)
Erotic, erotic
Erotic
Put your hands all over my body
All over me, all over me

I'd like to put you in a trance

I like to do a different kind of
Erotica, (give it up, give it up) romance
I'd like to put you in a trance

Put your hands all over my body

Only the one that hurts you can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts pain can take it away

190,deeper and deeper,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022407/Madonna/Deeper+and+Deeper,"Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do"
191,where life begins,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022406/Madonna/Where+Life+Begins,"I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about

I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you
In case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
""Finger lickin' good""
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood
Are you still hungry
Aren't you glad you came
I'm glad you brought your rain coat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is
That's where my love is
Come inside, that's where all life begins
It's warm inside"
192,waiting,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022404/Madonna/Waiting,"Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (just waiting)

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (just waiting)

Break my heart (waiting for you)
You broke my heart
You broke my heart (waiting for you, just waiting)
You broke my heart

Uh, next time you want pussy, huh
Just look in the mirror baby"

Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have
What she wants in a blink of an eye
Here she comes, acts like she's your best friend
Then you turn your back and she's off with your guy

What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her

So you give advice and she gives you her poison

First she spins her web and she's stealing your boyfriend

Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine
She's a thief, thief
She's a thief, thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?
Stop bitch!
Now sit your ass down"
194,words,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022402/Madonna/Words,"Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

You think you're so shrewd
You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Friends they tried to warn me about you
He has good manners, he's so romantic
But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know
I'm in love with your words
Your words

You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your (words)
Words, words

A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation (words)
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information (I've grown tired of your words)
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words"
195,did you do it?,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022398/Madonna/Did+You+Do+It%3F,"Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says 'Dre baby 'Dre baby oh
I said just relax, yo chill Mo
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
(Did you do it?) I said I did it
(Did you do it?) I said I did it
(Did you do it?) I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

(Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you)

Uh, Ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walkin' around showing off their hinies
Wigglin' they're jigglin' they're swingin' and flingin'
9-7-0 Yo Ho, your phone's ringin'
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chillin' in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinnin', you drunk too much gin in
Your jaw starts grinnin', and this is the beginnin'
Of a night of an average Ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (so what did you do)
I took 'er to my place (yo, did she sit on your face)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screamin', nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

They come with the rough stuff, boy we hit it, split it, and forget it
In the same order as ya hear, boy I'm not frontin'
Me not front, don't ask what, me tell ya the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get busy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different 'fros
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turnin' up my stereo

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
(Did you do it?) Yo, you know I did it
(Did you do it?) No more, I said I did it
(Did you do it?) Yo
I backed out quick because I thought I split it

(You didn't do it, he didn't do it)
I made her go

Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you

Waiting for you, just waiting

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you"
196,secret garden,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022397/Madonna/Secret+Garden,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
It's in my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden"

You found a way to touch my soul

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be

The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

You'll always be inside of my heart
Inside of me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone

These are my eyes, but they cannot see
These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness
And loneliness has never been a stranger to me, but

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow
This is my voice, but it's telling lies
I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness
And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me

And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Covered with dust and sin

Guilty of lust and sin

It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky, when the ground's open wide
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth
Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

Who needs the sun (With fluid steps)
Who needs the sky (Around the globe)
Who needs to sleep (I hear your voice)
You are (You are) my sanctuary
You are (You are, you are)
You are (You are) my sanctuary"

Traveling, traveling, leaving logic and reason
Traveling, traveling, I'm gonna relax
Traveling, traveling, in the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious

Let's get unconscious

And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

Let's get unconscious honey

Will it get me far
Should I lose some weight
Am I gonna be a star

I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life
Is it for me
This type of modern life
Is it for free

So I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life
Is not for me
This type of modern life
Is not for free

American life [American life]
I live the American dream [American dream]
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream [American life]

I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life
Is it for me
This type of modern life
Is it for free

Do I have to change my name
Will it get me far
Should I lose some weight
Am I gonna be a star

I get a double shotie
It goes right through my body
And you know I'm satisfied
I drive my mini cooper
And I'm feeling super-duper
Yo they tell me I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out their bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm diggin' on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied

I'd like to express my extreme point-of-view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

Do I have to change my name
Am I gonna be a star
Do I have to change my name
Am I gonna be a star
Do I have to change my name"

And the love direction
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much destruction
What I want is a celebration

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good"
209,nobody knows me,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022357/Madonna/Nobody+Knows+Me,"I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died

I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like-like you know me, like-like-like

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup, and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
(It's no fun but the damage is done) Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like, like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me

Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Like you know me (Won't read a magazine)

Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Don't want your social disease (Won't read a magazine)"
210,nothing fails,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022356/Madonna/Nothing+Fails,"I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me

It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

I'm not religious

But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here

I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me want to pray

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause you're the one

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved (But I feel so moved)
Makes me wanna pray (But I feel so moved)
Pray you'll always be here

I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna play)
But I feel so moved
I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna play)
Makes me wanna pray (Makes wanna play)

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved (Makes me wanna)
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray (Makes me wanna)

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails"
211,intervention,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022355/Madonna/Intervention,"I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly

I want to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I want to save his life

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

Sometimes it's such a pleasure
Sometimes I want to tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

In the blink of an eye everything could change
Say hello to your life, now you're living
This is it from now on
It's a brand new day
It was time to wake up from this dream (from this dream)

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
You'll never be the same

And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will change us forever
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will keep us together (that love, that love)

And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will change us forever
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will keep us together (that love, that love)

And I know (and I know), I know there is nothing to fear
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will take us away from here"

I'm not myself standing in a crowd
I'm not myself and I don't know how
I'm not myself, myself right now

Jesus Christ will you look at me
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

I'm not myself when you go quiet
I'm not myself alone at night
I'm not myself, don't know who to call
I'm not myself at all

Jesus Christ will you look at me
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

I always wished that I could find someone as beautiful as you
But in the process I forgot that I was special too

I'm not myself when you're around
I'm not myself standing in a crowd

There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
I gotta give it up

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up

I got to give it up
I got to to let it go
I gotta give it up
Oh mother
Oh father
I got to give it up

(I gotta give it up)

But I don't want an easy ride
What I want is to work for it
Feel the blood and sweat on my fingertips
That's what I want for me

I want to know everything
Maybe someday I will
What I want is to find my place
Breathe the air and feel the sun on my children's face
That's what I want

I go round and round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home

I want to let go of all disappointment
That's waiting for me
What I want is to live forever
Not defined by time and space
It's a lonely place
That's what I want

I go round and round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home

I go round and round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground I come full circle
To my place and I am home

I go round and round just
Round and round just"

Catch me on the floor
Working up a sweat

(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
Once I get going I am gone
(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
I'll keep it going all night long

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one)
That the light shines on

This complicated life
I try to do my best
I always tell myself
It's all just a test
For me it's an escape
'Cause dancing makes me feel beautiful

(And I can't pretend, it should never end, let the music play, are you watching now?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(You can really pop it now, it should never end, let the music play, cause I'm here to stay)
I'll keep on dancing through the night

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one)
That the light shines on

See my booty get down like,
See my booty get down like,
See my booty get down like,
See my booty get down like,

See my booty get down like

You probably think I'm crazy
I don't want you to save me
Don't mean to disappoint you
I've never felt so free
If you could stand in my shoes
Then you would feel my heartbeat too

Once I am moving, I'm alright

You never would believe those things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

All my dreams they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

When no one's around then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart,
When we're six thousand miles apart

Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we’re at our best when we're miles away

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone you realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles a-a-away

You always love me more, miles away

220,she's not me,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022333/Madonna/She%27s+Not+Me,"I should have seen the signs way back then
When she told me that you where her best friend
And now she's rolling rolling rolling
And you where stolen stolen stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it won't be the same)

I should have seen the sign when you weren't here
Under a different light it's oh so clear
She was stealing stealing stealing
And now your feeling feeling feeling
She started dying her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She's started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The feelings are momentary
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it wont be the same)

She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh devoted for life make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time I guarantee we are fine
She's not me

I know I can do it better
If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up all the things you like
You gonna have to watch your...

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (it wont be the same)

Never let you forget (She's not me)
She's Not Me and she'll never will be (repeat 2x)

Pharell-
Gotta find a new way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit say you love me love me
Guess my expectations hit the ceiling
When you come back it will cost us trust, trust me

She's not me, She's note me, She's not me and she'll never will be (x2)

Never will be"
221,incredible,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022332/Madonna/Incredible,"Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

Remembering the very first time
You caught that some ones' specials eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped

(I hope) I want to go back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it, to fill me

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening
And something is missing

(I hope) I want to go back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it, to fill me

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

I remember when
You were the one
You were my friend
You gave me life
You were the sun
You taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees
I didn't know why
I started to breathe
I wanted to cry
I need a reminder
So I can relate
I need to go back there
Before it's too late

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving

Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin'
But I just wanna give you more
Don't care bout nothin'
I'm fallin' for your love in the worst way

So move closer
I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And groove around the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's do ourselves to the world

Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on

In our zone
Do you wanna take it further
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep runnin' this race

I'm so into you...
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight

225,devil wouldn't recognize you,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022328/Madonna/Devil+Wouldn%27t+Recognize+You,"As quiet as it is tonight
You'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises
They cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars
There's something you should know
The angels they surround my heart
Telling me to let you go

I bet he couldn't
I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it
Who am I to criticize
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away.
Over and over I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now it's over, NO more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
I do, I do

You almost fooled yourself this time
That all the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile
And you keep your lost heartbreaks
The steps that edge along the ledge
Is much higher than it seems
That I've been on that ledge before
You can't hide yourself from me

I bet he couldn't
I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it
Who am I to criticize
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away.
Over and over I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now it's over, NO more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
I do, I do

It's like over and over you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away.
Over and over I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now it's over, NO more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do
I do, I do

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you."
226,voices,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022327/Madonna/Voices,"Who is the master? Who is the slave?

Treat me like a curse
And tell me I'm your savior
I'll never know the stranger
I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

First you say you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you
When you sold it to yourself

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?"

This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all
You believed in me, I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do? For our dream to survive?
How do we keep, all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me"

I'm not messing about, I've got a mile of self doubt
Yeah, you're not even close yet,
Because you're miles away
Another day in bed, sorting out your head
You don't know what you're thinking about 

You're not right all of the time
Its funny when you're wrong 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over 

You're the robot voice, and the people's choice
Yeah, you blink and it goes wrong
Because you're miles away
You're not even warm, human after all
You don't know what you're talking about 

You're not right all of the time
Its funny when you're wrong 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over, oh! 

I'm too skint to pay my debtors
Uh-oh un-opened letters
Feels like a siege I'm under
How did you get my number?
Oh oh, it's for the better
Than on the never ever
I'll get back and back and back
And back and back and back, around we go 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over 

Miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over

You think I have nothing
Without you by my side,
You'll see
Somehow, some way

You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see,
You think that you destroyed my faith in love.
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home,
You'll see
Somehow, someday

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive,
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

You think that you are strong, but you are weak
You'll see,
It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat.
I have truth on my side,
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, someday

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive,
I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free

Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing

It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

240,don't cry for me argentina,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/19303633/Madonna/Don%27t+Cry+for+Me+Argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"

Let all the hurt inside of you die

With good intentions, yeah

But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did 
What I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and 
I'm a give you what you want

Time is waiting
We only got four minutes 
To save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy
Grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes 
To save the world
No hesitating
We only got four minutes, 
Four minutes

Keep it up, keep it up, 
Don't be a pretty Madonna, uh
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pretty Madonna, uh
You gotta get in line, hop
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

Breakdown, yeah
(Tick tock tick tock tick tock)
Yeah, uh huh
(Tick tock tick tock tick tock)
I only got four minutes, to save the world"
247,for america,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32880320/Madonna/For+America,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

Wear shirts and boots 'cause it's okay to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading

But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl

I'll be your mistress tonight

Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it

And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way

You can never be the same

In a little bit of pain

I only hurt the ones I love

Just close your eyes

Trying to remember where it all began

Waiting for the time when earth shall be as one

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"
259,sidewalk talk,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/15041581/Madonna/Sidewalk+Talk,"Watch where you walk 'cause the sidewalks talk
And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it everyone will know

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

[Chorus]
Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak 'cause you gotta 'long the street
They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been mislead by the things you've said

[Chorus]

When you're living on the street
Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home

[Repeat: x3]
You can do it, uh huh

You can do it

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold

You better think twice when you cross the ice
Everything you do comes back to you
When you're shedding a tear sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x3]
You can do it, uh huh

You can do it"
260,what can you lose? ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26151742/Madonna/What+Can+You+Lose%3F+%5B%23%5D,"What can you lose?
Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her
What can you lose?

But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her
What if she had to choose?

Leave it alone
Hold it all in
Better a bone
Don't even begin
With so much to win
There's too much to lose"
261,more ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26151738/Madonna/More+%28End+Credits%29+%5B%23%5D,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
[More! More!]

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
[More! More!]

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
[Except all, all, all]
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all [have it all]
You may find all else above [find all else above]
That though things are bliss,
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!"

So young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
You were just a backstreet girl
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting

High flying, adored
Did you believe in your wildest moments
All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?

Were there stars in your eyes
When you crawled in at night
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall

High flying, adored
What happens now, where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you

High flying, adored
I hope you come to terms with boredom
So famous so easily, so soon
It's not the wisest thing to be

You won't care if they love you
It's been done before
You'll despair if they hate you
You'll be drained of all energy
All the young who've made it would agree

Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

Chorus:

You're a man with a gun in your hand,
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

(chorus)

All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, I would never let you go.

(chorus, with last line:)
'Cause I can show you some fun

(spoken) And I don't mean with a gun. No.

You are a man with a gun in your hand;
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun, take it out of your hand;

267,confessions ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/9985090/Madonna/Confessions+%5BLive%5D,"I have a tale to tell

I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard
That it sends your body flying across the room
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge, isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world, I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside he loved me

It was a time I suffered so much
I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms, not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain
That was eating me inside, nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and it invades me

I believe we are messengers on earth
I believe in Angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much
To become who I am today

Now you have to realize not only do I have a family
But now I have a whole hood and that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang, I just wanted to fit in

But one day I was forced to do something
That made me open my eyes and realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said you know what to do really, it's time to get poppy for the hood

That was not to kill anybody"

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

Hope I live to tell

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well

Dice are rolling, the knives are out
Would-be presidents are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground

(Eva:)
It doesn't matter what those morons say
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only twenty of them anyway
What is twenty next to millions who
Are looking to you?

All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll...you'll be handed power on a plate
When the ones who matter have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree to be called

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment, and that is why
All exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay

(Eva:)
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide, there's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be denied

(Eva:)
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems, he shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the workers' battle song
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Rings out loud and long

(Eva:)
Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me

(All:)
A new Argentina, a new age about to begin
A new Argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

(Eva:)
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the Big Apple

But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country

(Eva:)
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(All:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied

(Che:)
How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause
The inconvenience, having to get a majority
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause
There are other ways of establishing authority

(All:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and will not be, and must not be denied."
274,act 2. rainbow tour,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/9805688/Madonna/Act+2.+Rainbow+Tour,"(Peron:)
People of Europe, I send you the Rainbow of Argentina
(Che:)
Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much
(Aide #1:)
She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
(Aide #2:)
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
(Che:)
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard
(Aide #1:)
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
(Aide #2:)
But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card
Chorus:
(Peron and Aides:)
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is yes
(Peron:)
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?
(Che:)
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why
(Eva:)
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!
(Italian admiral:)
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
(Aide #2:)
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
(Che:)
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
(Aide #1:)
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye
(chorus)
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is ...
(Che:) A qualified
(Aides:) Yes
(Che:)
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
(Che:)
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now
(Aide #1:)
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow
(Che:)
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required
(chorus)
(Aide #2:) Would Evita win through?
(Aide #1:) And the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) No
(chorus)
(Aides:) Would Evita win through? But the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Aide #1:) Yes
(Aide #2:) Yes"

276,lament,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30372629/Madonna/Lament,"The choice was mine, and mine completely
I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time

Remember I was very young then
And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?
I saw the lights, and I was on my way

And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

The choice was yours and noone else's
You can cry for a body in despair
Hang your head because she is no longer there
To shine, to dazzle, or betray
How she lived, how she shone
But how soon the lights were gone

Eyes, hair, face, image
All must be preserved
Still life displayed forever
No less than she deserved."

For inspiration
Come on

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy what will it be

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I wanna dance with someone else

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time:
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina...

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"

You could be good for me
I've had the taste for danger

If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Heaven forbid
I'll take my chance on a beautiful stranger

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song

To know you
Is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

To love you
Is to be part of you
I paid for you with my tears
And swallowed all my pride

Beautiful stranger
Beautiful stranger

If I'm smart then I'll run away
But I'm not so I guess I'll stay
Haven't you heard?
I fell in love with a beautiful stranger

I looked into your face
My heart was dancing all over the place
I'd like to change my point of view
If I could just forget about you

To know you
Is to love you
You're everywhere I go
And everybody knows

To love you
Is to be part of you
I paid for you with my tears
And swallowed all my pride

I looked into your eyes
And my world came tumbling down
You're the devil in disguise
That's why I'm singing this song to you

Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one

I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light

You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me"
