0,homicide,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36219604/Eminem/Homicide,"Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahaha

F*ck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, f*ck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady with rabies

I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school, ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, it's a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

F*ck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, f*ck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (doot, doot, doot) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place, but if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked, you gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

F*ck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, f*ck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like Jay-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed now, chicka-chicka-chicka, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered

Hold up, I said Rover because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (roof) like the doberman said
I still think the (roof) would go over your head (haha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit with so many foul lines
You think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best? I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though, 'cause MC's know

But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
And you're trapped in your cell phone
On my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't want to fuckin' listen to you spit your rap someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mil'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular f*ck, like f*ck rap

I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With the Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug it, fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare knuckle it, nah, f*ck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket, abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, f*ck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while you panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagan's, tryin' to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this stand up banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floor boards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins, lapkins and chapki
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm papkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flammina babbita playin' a jampkin
Dammit, a can of pa"
1,rainy days ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35949116/Eminem/Rainy+Days+%5Bfeat.+Eminem%5D,"Nigga, I wear fur coats in the summer, nigga
Wife beaters in the winter, damn
Uh, shit

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

Yo, yo, aw, man
Yo, word to the titles
So word to my idols and word to the goats (Uh)
I ain't sayin' I like 'em
I'd kill all them niggas and wear 'em as coats (Uh)
Word to the feelings I channel
I lose 'em as quick as a fuckin' remote (Uh)
Don't be callin' me woke (No)
I cheat on my queen for a hoe
That's how shit go, she keep sayin' we chill (Ayy)
She gon' come out her shell (Woah)
Ain't no pushin' my buttons
When all of my feelings is stuck on a wheel (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm thirsty and blessed (Ayy)
I pour liquor in grills (Woah)
This for my niggas in jail, wrestlin' L's (Uh)
That's that hell in the cell
I come from a place where the shit can get shady
My chances was slim (Ayy)
All my women was basic
We see different races since signing to him (Yeah)
I can't send out no message to none of my exes
And bitches as friends (Ayy)
I can't blow it again
Need a bitch that's as thick as my skin, shit 'cause

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

I left my legacy hurt? Fuckin' absurd
Like a shepherd havin' sex with his sheep, f*ck what you heard
All this talk in my ear, I got a idea
Like the clerk when you tryna buy beer (ID ya)
Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare
F*ck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye
I got the bottle of NyQuil right here (Right here)
You want the sleep me to wake, you want Slim Shady EP
That's on the CD cover, sockin' my mirror (Sockin' my mirror)
I promise not to cry crocodile tears (Crocodile tears)
If you end up shocked at my lyrics (Shocked at my lyrics)
Marshall is dead in the water, but not that I care
Dre said, ""Rock the boat"" and the Doc is my pier
So, it's unanimous, you're at attention, the planet's listenin'
And their banana splits again, which has its advantages
But when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickenson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture, then ripped it in half
And whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many rounds or if I get knocked down
In a bout and fell to the ground
I got a fighter's mentality, I'll get back up and fight with it
In fact, I'ma attackin' the mic with it
I'll make it sound (Sound) like a vampire's bitin' it
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick (Sidekick)
To be down for the count (Haha), yeah
Yo, album's (What?), out (Yeah), now (Uh)
Pow (Pow), wow (Woo), I don't (Huh), see no (Uh) clouds (Nah)
But ain't gon' (No) be no (Huh) drought (Uh-uh)
Smile (No), frown (Yeah), upside (Ah) down (Ya)
Shut my (Nope) mouth (Yeah), how? (How)
That ain't what (What) I'm 'bout
Shout (Shout), showers (F*ck it, ow, ow)
Thug it out (Ow), 'cause

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just hope I never, damn (I just hope I never)
I just pray I never, f*ck (I just pray I never)
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Rainy days, uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Hang today, uh)
I need changes in a major way, a way (Major way, uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away"
2,remember the name,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36259009/Eminem/Remember+the+Name,"Yeah, I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin'"", like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey

I can still remember (what), tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (yeah)
became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (what) if I'd prevail (huh)
And all I did was (what) put Nine Inch Nails (where)
In my eyelids now (what), I'm seein' diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means, if rap was skinny jeans
I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splittin' seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means no if, ands, or buts, are squeezin' in-between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fucking living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me
I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean (ow!)
Shinin' wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, that shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king, bring me fifty bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to get super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey (ow!)"
3,hip hop,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36584804/Eminem/Hip+Hop,"Yeah huh
(hip hop hip hop hip hop)
Turn the mic up a little bit
(hip hop)
Get some of this Cali weedo
(hip hop)
Listen to some motherfuckin'
(hip hop)
Haha
(Sounds like gold, sounds like street, whoo
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C)

Hip hop, (hip hop) That's the way of life
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab the pen and pad, and start to jot some
Always told myself, that I would never be losin
Man, I ain't have no hood, my mother was always movin
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn, mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step-dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, then the force got stronger
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is hip hop (hip hop)
Man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi! ""What up?"" Give me a beat box
(beatbox)

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop (hip)
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, (whoo)
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

From the hip hop Shop to Maurice Malone
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore (D12!)
Hell yeah, I looked in my car
Bitch, I was homeless, I slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas had to do what's best, it was a mess
All them taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't by an ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go the car and get them things
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the Beastie Boys
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and the niggas in the club
To the E Dubbs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come
{gun sprays}

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop (hip)
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, (whoo)
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, and I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff to Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seeger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun, I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryna let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughin' cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thing
I used to have this theory, keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no C-C-W license
I tried to apply for one, they said it take 5-6 months
What the f*ck am I supposed to do meanwhile when rivals come?
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple-platinum, I ain't tryna catch no murder 1
Figured I'd shoot the womb, probably missin' at least one
But the other one's f*ck his shoulder and his knee cap up
And I'm a say for self-defense how come I had the gun
Is because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'll get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to
Havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded
Once I got and I thank God it was empty the night I got caught with it
What the f*ck man, I thought that it was supposed to be

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop (hip)
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, (whoo)
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the MPC"
4,caterpillar,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35019312/Eminem/Caterpillar,"You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Oh, we in the war
Where butterflies keep dyin' (ah)

I'm a product of Parker, Lewis and Kubiak
If didn't do this, where in the f*ck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lion and sip hyenas
You number one when it comes to slaughtered mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uh, all you niggas my lil' rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rapper, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets, I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinating
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
Out here congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I'll bring adequate to these patterns and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Oh, we in the war
Where butterflies keep dyin' (ah)

This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Here take your number one, quit
Number one soul, get your number one chip
Number one fly with your number one kicks
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do
Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you gas you up
And tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional
You always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to what we're retracting to
I do what I want to do, they do what I let them do
Everything niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
There is nothing I can say to you that is good
Remember when you raisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever fucking disrespect the caterpillar

This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Here take your number one, quit
Number one soul, get your number one chip
Number one fly with your number one kicks
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

You lookin at Atilla
The psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper isn't even half as ill
A savage still, the tracks a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva when he snapped his shin in half 
And then had shit hangin' by a flap of skin 
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies
My offspring's are just moths
If I see that thing, I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall, set the sprinklers off
Like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah, 'til the shingles come off the roof
We'll shatter the ceilings
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I'd think I would help you distinguish
A brother from the cream of the crop
Wait a minute, hold up
Like a flash card
Damn dog, is that copyin', or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather
I have to rehatch on you
Come back as black wasp
Half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancin' on top of a Ant, 
Trample it and stomp it, smash it and stand on it
Dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag and I can't stop goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's is manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites
You make a wack song, and can't hold a candle
But even Daniel-san wax off, you jack-offs
Need to come to grips, like a hand job
The boom bap is back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number two 'cause that's all I do with 'em
Poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I droppin' a deuce and
When I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen them
Bitch it is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon 
And I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb and I'm bustin' you"
5,the ringer,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368569/Eminem/The+Ringer,"Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts 
And see where this takes me, 
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the f*ck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the f*ck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause 
I just don't get what the f*ck half the shit is that you're listening to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil' Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna f*ck on my bitch? 
(F*ck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll just turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the f*ck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us?"" (Ooh-ooh)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'Zae
Lil' Pump, Lil' Xan imitate Lil' Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the f*ck are you gonna do? Where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached, my enemies die
I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date,"" ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, Mookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
6,greatest,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368568/Eminem/Greatest,"Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah), sayin' I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin' tell them make me (bitch), eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo), wanna be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who made it, it's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Steven Paddock with automatic stay spray
At anything that may stand in their way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan tasks cam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs
Ain't givin' ways ankle the ways you chumps don't
Even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat
If you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
Then you better take it back to the shelter
And Hamburger Helper, 'cause damn it I'm still the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way I misprounouced a name
""DIE ANTWOORD!""
F*ck, I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the f*ck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs to let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout, now get the f*ck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' everyone up in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
best to ever do it, best to ever do it, best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
F*ck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the SIG lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly, I'ma sting like a bee, you ain't harmin' a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I know one day I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
best to ever do it, best to ever do it, best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest"
7,lucky you,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368567/Eminem/Lucky+You,"Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
F*ck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
F*ck you too, woah!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't f*ck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not f*ck with you guys
If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangin'
Some chains and some blades in and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just drop four like an Uno
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto
Lookin' for something that prolly can never find out
Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now
What you would nigga? You really want me tied down
I've been alone, I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower

I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
F*ck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, f*ck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
F*ck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the f*ck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And f*ck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps, let's recap
Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks
Eight DATs with the G raps and Kane's hat
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
That you're a button to press or a lever to pull
They give me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'ma sleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker never got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ay
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a writer might've fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

Um, I listened to the new album
Um, are you really gonna just reply to everybody who 
You don't like what they have to say, uh
About you or the stuff you're working on? 
I mean, I don't know if that's really a great idea
It's, it's like, what's next? Kamikaze 2
The album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made 
Replying to everybody that didn't like the previous album
It's a slippery slope
I don't know if it's a really good idea
Um, anyway, hit me back"

10,normal,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368565/Eminem/Normal,"Yo, how do I keep
(I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, told her why I'm soulless, she's

Heartless, no wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger

She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun'
We over but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the f*ck did I get so twisted?
I picked someone that's so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seein'
She's only mine for the time bein'
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hoppin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the f*ck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo
Flip me off right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?
Yeah, I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?"

13,stepping stone,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368563/Eminem/Stepping+Stone,"It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof, wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is clear

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Bacardi in hand, never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift, all the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words

But I guess they're just honored for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to but I'm fighting for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm under the sink, but it was not my intent

To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road, done all we possibly can
I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"

That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (woah)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spider move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We can not give a f*ck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya, it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us 

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ayy)
The people you run with are thuggin' (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, in other words if you're a Gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and f*ck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
His tough demeanor, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne 
If you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you but you already know who the f*ck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as f*ck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, rarely but this time Shady 
'Bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy
Cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and I told him 
The moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein, a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is Groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Rolex to Goldman and I'm throat-sprayin' tryna throw to Nicole
They both hate to choke and my whole plate is chokin'
And I double-edge sworded 'cause one place 
I poke and I stick and I turn and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle 
Of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formidable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nuttin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One month older
Sponge, mob, colder
Nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster
Lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the (man, f*ck this shit, let's go)"

Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, welp (fack, fack)

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I tea-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I am the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serial killin' every beat there is, but wait

Wait, got the eeriest feelin', somethin' evil is lurkin'
I'm no conspiracy theorist but somethin' here is a foot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (what?)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot"
16,fall,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35378067/Eminem/Fall,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Line 'em up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted 
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spit like this in his last shit""
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up""
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Gifford, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sac-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is 
To help you put together some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Ha
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to f*ck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and f*ck themselves 
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em
See the show, every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary 
In my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly 
And what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 
'Cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Brush my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, 
The Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat 
Piss and moan, but I'm not gonna fall, bitch!

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire"

You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home right
Right, sike

Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man

I hop in your whip and take a sip then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin'
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes
But females be rushin' me outside my tele, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home right
Right, sike

Suck my dick, you fucking suck bitch
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man (bih)
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck (bih)
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man

I'm playin' music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael Bullard
You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La proxima yo se que mejor me quedo sola
Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola
I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks
You hope that I choke on a Pepsi
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
F*ck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say ""Don't come over"" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing
Why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing by"
18,good guy,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368558/Eminem/Good+Guy,"Here we go, again, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?
Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for
When you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass
When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the date
I can hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him""
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core
But the pain I'm in, after you I swore
To make the gray skies ene
Here comes the rays like wind
You get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or?
Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream ""F*ck you""
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in

Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
Can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
Play like you're the good guy, play like, play like
Play like you're the good guy"

Why the f*ck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too

Into ya, look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the f*ck's happened
End of ya, when you're bit with the

Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(When they get bit with the)

(When they get bit with the)

I said, ""Knock knock, let the devil in, alien""
E-E-Elliot phone home, ain't no telling when this choke hold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, double-aught, Buckshot
Tied her up to a garrote
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the f*ck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me

Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment-um

21,killshot,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35452290/Eminem/Killshot,"You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the f*ck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
F*ck, your beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
We doin' this once
Your beard's weird, why you yellin' at the mic?

Rihanna just hit me on the text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me, I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next, damn
I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordic Track
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (Slim you're old)
Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gun, I bet you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still
Are you eating cereal, or oatmeal?
What the f*ck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
Dictionary
Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you're the whack me
It's funny, but so true
I'd rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you
'Til I'm hitting old-aged still can fill a whole page with a 10 year old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailey in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the f*ck?)
Bein' rich, aimed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
It's your moment, this is it
As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort, but if I was three
Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be this solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what fuckin' good is a machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the f*ck can him and I battle?
He'll have to f*ck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write, Not Alike
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it, Kells?
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' whack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' AutoTune, so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth, and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin', oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy, you know I love you"
22,nowhere fast,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35123778/Eminem/Nowhere+Fast,"Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas
Another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to, it's blowin' up
And this whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets
And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
Their loaded weapons
They love their guns more than our children
Shh, think another one just entered in our buildin'
And we'll be

Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
F*ck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass
Knowing we're fearless, 'cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah (we don't give a no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
F*ck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
Goin' nowhere fast

F*ck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year-old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways, for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin' we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch f*ck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah (we don't give a, no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
F*ck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere (we're on the run of our lives)
Going nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other
When we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh-oh
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is

Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a, no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
F*ck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere (we're on the run of our lives)
Goin' nowhere fast"

The G5'll get me out there in an hour now
The MAC movin’ like crack, I'm sellin' powder now
G-game over, locker room, hit them showers now
I got the trophies and the catalogue
Just did a deal, Mercedes-Benz, just check the catalogue
I'm buyin' buildings, we don't buy the blogs

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also someone's wife
So time we spend is borrowed
It's our moment, right here, f*ck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear all
Nice and easy as hair, when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle

She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is so fucked
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch now, just hold up""
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need Q-Tip for the culture

Speed it up a little bit
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the motherfucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we renovate
And re-develop hella weights, and I'ma get a special place, now
Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind, I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you're fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of f*ck it
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me, duck it
Let me keep it one hundred, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won’t give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey

Yo, yo, let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that
You trippin', did you pack?
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack
Here, take a Nicki pack, check out this Nicki act
Nicki this Nicki that, all these bitches piggyback
Nicki back, ah, ah, ah back
Ah, ah, ah back
Ah, ah

Out ah road dem lovin' my style
The mandem want digits fi dial
Inna the dance, we a go skin out I know
And when I come out, gyal suicidal
Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol
Gotta be dumb to make me your rival
'Cause I'm too powerful, and you not powerful

Die slow, die slow
Jealousy is a disease, die slow
Die slow, die slow
Tell her that jealousy is a disease, die slow"

Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet isn't it?
I really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fucking coming true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house, take your shoes, take your heart

Now here comes that singing part
I'm daydreaming
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (get you) or how I'll make you pay
Babe, I'm hurtin' (hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same
That's my plan (that's my plan)
That's my plan
That's my plan

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime but listen man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word we make it sting for him
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye you piece of shit
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it

Here comes that singing part
I'm daydreaming (I'm daydreaming)
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)

Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

Well, in the beginning we felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee, but hell with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
It feels like it'll take a century to heal, but just know that I will
But f*ck trying to make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz with all your lady friends, whores 
Hit the club and you go out don't know a sum
'Cause when I calculate the times you cheated and total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up 'cause you say that just giving out your number doesn't count (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new get mad and flip it look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it (stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it)
Slut! 
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me while I'm driving to hers
Just remember
You cheated on me first
You're a whore, you're a whore
This is war

Fellas, ladies

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (f*ck, yeah!) (F*ck, no!)"

Introducin' the star of our show, his name is

Marshall!

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you

Marshall!

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Hell Yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

Let's get down to business

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business

Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because

And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray

Same blond hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming

This ain't beef man
I don't know what the f*ck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?

I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

[Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who want to die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't want to hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

[Xzibit]
Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the F*CK?! (Who the F*CK?!) you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!

[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - see'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ""Ether""
(Not) I shoulda crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man.. {*scratched* - ""Watch your fuckin mouth""}

[Chorus]
[Eminem]
For the last time man, I'm through"
27,the real slim shady,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34672970/Eminem/The+Real+Slim+Shady,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so f*ck him and f*ck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a f*ck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
F*ck it, let’s all stand up!"
28,no favors,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34087450/Eminem/No+Favors,"Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors

I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice
I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice
I'm about taking a risk, that might f*ck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like ""niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too""
Thought I had the Midas touch
And then I went platinum too
Mother f*ck all your comparisons
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
So He must be hearing shit
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Others get the hit with the laugh
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
So you know where I came from
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
Connected to a higher power
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stopping like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T.
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors

If she was flavor I won't savor
No taste buds, hoe later
F*ck you looking at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And f*ck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin ‘em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"", pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
Cause I'ma—

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from em, no favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? no favors

(I know you feeling yourself right now
But I'm not sure she's the one
I would call them in) – ""Hey, I'm outside""
What are you doing here?"
29,believe,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675916/Eminem/Believe,"And I started from the bottom, like a
Snowman, ground up, like round chuck 
And still put hands on you, stayin' wound up
That's how I spin time, sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes
I just got that air about me, like wind chimes
Another day in the life, used to have to scrape to get by
Now my community is gated and I made it and my neighbors say hi
I'm givin' em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days off
Minimum wage for, general labor
Welfare recipient as a minor
Look for government assistance has made you
Adversity if at first shit don't succeed
Put your temper to more use 'cause being broke is a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, got it's like a, almost
Got it, but close only counts in time bombs and horse shoes
So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick)
No remorse
Screw it, I'm lit, and that's the attitude I blew up on
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done, nah, bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe
In me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
Do you still believe? I'll never quit
In me?

Man I know some times these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me, there's just ink blots
I just fling them like slingshots, and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef can at least cost you your career
Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger is free as a bird
New warhead-ed birth, you just forehead-ed on earth
Too short for a verse, studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate america
Stick a fork in it and turn
'Cause four letter words are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
You're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consulting when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the tunnel so people are always looking at me when they're going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" when I was having trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
I'm going to get you jacked up, like you're trying to fix a flat (uh)
When you struggle with a spare
That double fisted bear, knuckles coupled with the spare
Nuts, I'm cuppin' I am your f*ck it switch nothing can compare

Do you still believe
In me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
Do you still believe? I'll never quit
In me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe, and smoke that
But my battery is low
I'm gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof on my back
I called you a groupie cause I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm calling on you 'cause I think I'm slowly
Startin' to lose faith in it so, give me that inkling and
Motivation to go, who's insane with the flow
Fake fans with the two faced that show
Let heartbeat produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose chains
'Cause all I dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginning
So that goes for you too
So what the f*ck you gon' do, use the tools you're given
Or are you going to use the cards you were dealt as an excuse to not do shit with them
I used to play the loser victim
Until I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stack decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I run in place while this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pains when you've won the race
When that pool of exhaust is cooling off
'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove at all
'Cause you already hit them with the coup de gras
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with that Bruce Will
It's that blue steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose I won't loose will
Do you still believe?"
30,untouchable,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675914/Eminem/Untouchable,"Hands up, officer don’t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the f*ck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to f*ck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops f*ck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
F*ck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the f*ck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build"
31,river,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675913/Eminem/River,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his next grasp to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress less, mismatch
On his breast jackets is sex addict
And cheaters want to egg sack it for being checked, get back
It's a chest match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't f*ck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knifing hands, says the relationship hanging by a strip
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to Spiderman
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said ""Bye Suzanne"" after the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One night stand turned into night stayin'
It was cold, some lights gram
Y'all be hung tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did adverse to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and suited
When it's too hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in cursin' to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just still like the person who I'm turnin' into
Irreversible, I pray for you like a church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soap box and breach, my sermon in speech
Detergent and bleach is burned in the womb
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this bullshit in new
To use protection 'fore I pity to your forbidden crew, f*ck

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh)
My name's (ooh)
Denver, never run
Call me (ooh)
Call me (ooh)
River (ooh)
We'll let the river run

Always the bride's maid, never ""The bride, hey!""
What can I say? If life was a highway
The sequels are non-clay
But be swerving in side lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice maybe
That's why I'm made, that came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight, what I made you
Terminate my baby
This love triangle, left us in a rectangle
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
That I really woulda' loved your smile
Didn't really want to abort
But f*ck it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something (I'm sorry, I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run"

Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals, get on the floor
When I pop up on some whack a mole shit
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'
I spot you at first glance and go, ""shit""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That part won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate

That's why I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight, too (yo)
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear, like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Bean
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten, so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the diamonds and the jukebox
Two shots, a blue hypnotic and soon I
Turn this brooha to a barroom brawl
So hit smash on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)

(Say can I take you home, where we can be alone?)
Shawty, you the shit
Girl, I order you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides ya (I love)
Like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides, hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl, you're so fucking fly
You belong in the mile high club
So come on baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high strung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' for, we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing' a light bulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim, and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda
But

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)"
33,revival ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675910/Eminem/Revival+%28Interlude%29,"I've drowned and high from the ashes now
I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything, I'll grasp at ends
Or what's left over
And the lights in every broken, blown out window
Screaming, laughing
I like to feel it coursing out
This is our revival"
34,bad husband,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675908/Eminem/Bad+Husband,"We never saw from each other's sides
Or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news
Love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun
Actually used to run
Back to the booth
Jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue
Lash out on you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb
Stone it was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once
And that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because

How come you can be a low illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailey
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod
When my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks
In that tiny box
When we tied the knot
When we broke the knot
Every line we crossed
We were supposed to not
Every time we fought
Being souls they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we could've read
Which maybe would've lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I said I wasn't sitting here asking myself

How come you can be a low illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
There's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now
And all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us to not hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard mockingbird
And got the urge to jot me some verses
And thoughts the purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused a few, and so have you
Or argue who's fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine
But really no ones, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh f*ck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We was so nuts, back stab each other, another blow struck
But there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over
And it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people could be so good at one thing 
And so fucked at a whole 'nother shit it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
There's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"
35,tragic endings,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675907/Eminem/Tragic+Endings,"I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to f*ck it up again
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

All my life, I was told
I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it
Every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot the hell up
I'm fallin' helplessly, I'm embarrassed
And I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit
Every time she yells at me
Selfishly indeed
Definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip
Now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms
I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string
She lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain
But I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me
My friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious
And enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture
When she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her
In this war
When she gets going, she don't stop
When I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her
It was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton
Of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground
For me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it
When I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the f*ck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

It took a while for me to get it
But I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna
See me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy
Destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces
Brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me
Get this straight, then say ""screw her""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick
I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door
So here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light now, I'm running to it
What the f*ck? Should've knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings"
36,framed,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675906/Eminem/Framed,"Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's
Freaky tales (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking, but I wanna stick her like she decals
But when murdering females, better pay attention to these details
Or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a f*ck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities bursting outta me, please, beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs""
Chop her up, put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's trailer
And leave 'em there

But, hey, man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew something was wrong
Think I'm becoming monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But, dog, how the f*ck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it, to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond
'Cause it's incumbent upon
Me, plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl
The motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collecting newspaper articles, cutting up seconds from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper cut my public defender's
Jugular, then stuck up in the blender
Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

But, hey, man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap looking like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen, for raping eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked when I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen, I lay in wait, adjacent facing the door remaining patient
While staying complacent, blatant 
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow, in hopes that when you get home
You'll get the hint ho, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me
I could describe a murder scene in a verse
And be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly 
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary

No officer, you see I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed"
37,heat,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675904/Eminem/Heat,"Wanna take it from the top?

Lady you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you can set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you I actually said to myself, ""I gotta meet her like a taxi""
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
You sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camero
I'm tryin' to catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the meow, hope it's not a problem in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this bomb in your cap
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following back
About six cars, I'm in the Lak
And I want to

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the connivence store
But those jeans you wore, I've never seen before
I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
Pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (yo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror, she's rapping my shit
But she wasn't aware, I was there, or maybe she was, and just did't care
Who knows, at least that ain't up in the air
It's something to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But f*ck the Pepe Le Pu shit
""Ain't stepping to you bitch"", I say to myself
Plus she's bumping my music, and chasing no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her, to some degree
And f*ck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
F*ck it, pull up beside her
Side swipe her, Dodge Viper
Wood is upright I asked if she wants a computer lodged up her vagina
Said my dick is an Apple
She said ""put it inside her""
I said

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
'Cause it just died like ""ooh, food coloring, duh""
So let's get turnt, like a shish kebob, twist it Ma
Like an air conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water, I bet you get yourself a steam
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner
You got puns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of Ds
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred me in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle finger, to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you saw you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm want it

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Under ones and twos, to three or four in the morning
Rick's for the cut like Neosporin (what)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand

Who the f*ck, it's my big dick, so everybody get ready right fucking now"
38,offended,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675903/Eminem/Offended,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shotty entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'""
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
But 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald
Shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her
While I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the Xanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll, a Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled, (Em) so's my manager
Bitch I'm amateur, f*ck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push in to kaputt you when I
Pull 'em like, sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
And I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a 10, you're an 8
Like what I do before, after, and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees
It's the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like lodi partner, blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get to soakin', try to get to poke the hole in
While you hose me off, and nope I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
I got a lotta more
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head, I never hunted for the bread
And what I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply
Because, I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds"
39,need me,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675902/Eminem/Need+Me,"You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what wouldn't I do for you

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile, as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what wouldn't I do for you

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

I'm starting to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults and there's no excuse for the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's?
No, you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her, 'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Now her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble, she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian River 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I have a shit-eating grin when I smile
Making an excuse for her, start actin' out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief
I don't believe in going to bed mad
I keep on trying to make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times
And bad, I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead
'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a ""should I?""
Leave me for good? You never would
Now it'd be your bad
Never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person, too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep putting my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
I'm in trouble but I can't leave
I'd sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you
What is that?
I'm co-dependent
I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it
Nor the heart, our apartment's tore apart
You're using my heart for a dart board
But God must've found stars for us 'cause somebody paired us up
And they say he ain't capable of making a mistake
But this one's perfect 'cause I'm

I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me"

Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packing up my shit
As much shit in the car as I can fit 
And I'm just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems, 'til all my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like, 'cause tonight I'm starting life again
Get to the corner and stop, f*ck am I going
Besides sight going when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over, yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothing like
Holding your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
F*ck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing
But back, to right where I was and perhaps, this could've been my victory lap
If I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It seems to be the reoccurring main thing
The shit I would daydream as a kid I was 18
I went from an irate teenager
Still raging as adult, amazing
Back then I put everything into the 
Rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy, or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it (did what?) Hailie
Baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe, I should've did a better job at separating
Shady, and entertaining, from real life, but this
Dang thing, is still the hardest thing to explain
Is the crazy, or should I ever seen it back then
It was like I ain't even bother taking into consideration
You and baby and older and making me say things
I did it, yay me, and be, it just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentle, men let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit
(Or should I?) sound cranky and bitter
Complain beef and bicker about the same things
'Cause when I look at me I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get a, way and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head

41,castle,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675900/Eminem/Castle,"I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December first, nineteen ninety-five, Dear Hallie)

You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me but as long as you’re healthy
That’s all that matters for the time being but obviously
Assuming you will be, just thinking ahead
I'ma make it if it kills me, let’s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
I'm sorry for sloppy writing, the pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm 
As I'm using in this letter maybe they can fuel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world
Love, daddy
Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December first, nineteen ninety-six) 

Dear Hallie
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile 
but you ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, lil' minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em baby
I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios while I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far
I just keep steering I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My infinite CD flock, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something
Ooh, I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December twenty-fourth, two thousand and seven)

Dear Hallie
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between 'em since I rise to this fame
I said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you 
but dang, I never knew it'd be like this
If I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished fed up with it, I'm hanging it up
F*ck it! Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote 
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy
Love dad
Shit, I don't know"
42,walk on water,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34584874/Eminem/Walk+on+Water,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butterflies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
’til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, ""this shit is garbage""
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the f*ck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a f*ck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Every thought scarred got, now my pants off
The crosswalk, it's suspenders
And I can't feel my lips cause

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb"
47,campaign speech,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33416845/Eminem/Campaign+Speech,"Jumped out of the second floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and hence the origin of the headless horseman
Born with the endorphin's of a pathetic orphan
Endless sores and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have been vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores in sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in
Self absorption
Skeletor, I went to hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus
Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes of course, I mess up once
You want some? Come and get some, boys
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back
His whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm desert storm
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible, hello gorgeous
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get sexual?""
She said, ""However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible""
Expired tags on the Saturn
Got Kathryn Beck in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter, laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid...

You got it twisted
All 'cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic
Bitch get to massagin' this dick
Like spas in this bitch
Slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit like I've gone ballistic
With a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, ""I hate blondes,"" and became one
I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets
Trouble 'cause a double cross
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to 'cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results
As Rainman's is
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage""
What's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-f*ck persona
To my last DNA strand, E&J in the waistband
At the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa
Pre-arrange an escape plan
Three inch blade on point like a Sensei
Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one

Great idea!

If I was president
Gettin' off is the first order of business
Once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screamin', ""F*ck safe sex,"" throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned
And make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it
I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'till I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The board hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
'Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The rock cuts into rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelling quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face 'till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly I'm gone off you
Man light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket"
48,kill for you,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33309079/Eminem/Kill+for+You,"You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if there is a terrible crime
It's alright, 'cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name
Sing a song, 'cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there
You gon' make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

Oh, Lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

In your dream, you're drowning, I just waltzed in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwashed and persuade you
Gibraltar, you're faithful, never falter or waver
When you causing the danger I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
To the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed the First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped, put our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Whatever you have to do, you blast for me
I never doubt
That you

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you"

Real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shot when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
F*ck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""F*ck you, Debbie!""

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

Don't let me find out, the snitch in you

Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
F*ck the world now
I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders
Go f*ck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose
And kill yourself
Doctor's orders

Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating
Ain't nobody graduating
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm getting aggravated, f*ck, I'm getting agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the f*ck is going on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix
It's looking like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients man, how come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money, why?
When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are, just admit 'fore you get admitted

Say, what you living about
F*ck you gon' tell me
Do you remember how you started out though
You looking lost now
(You want a pass, oh damn)
Fake it 'til you make it
Take your little paper book
When you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not
That's word to doc

Fame and fortune
It's not your forte

Go f*ck yourself
Take two a day
Set them on an overdose

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a f*ck about my descent, 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a f*ck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something
Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waiting for has come but

Fame and fortune
It's not your forte
F*ck the world now

51,kings never die,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32020234/Eminem/Kings+Never+Die,"Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Too good to be true?
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
Think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, f*ck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
F*ck what these cynics say
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm coming to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

(They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
Just grow wings and they fly, so
Hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over)

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
Kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain’t the same
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die"

But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it

Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight up to my best friend

God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it, it's like Clint Eastwood
Looking for peace though, maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked so I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause I'm a sinner
(I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend) Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival
Your arch enemy surrounds you now he's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's in-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script
Cock and I shoot
Who you think's my glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah"
53,phenomenal,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32015539/Eminem/Phenomenal,"I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Show ‘em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy
Who the f*ck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
'Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the f*ck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists to his bones
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it off like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-up valve
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about
'Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is delegation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
An accusation, I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
'Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
'Cause I am

Phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal"
54,speedom ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32897746/Eminem/Speedom+%5BWwc2%5D,"I get to busting like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm ripping the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""what we doin'?,"" I said to I'm, let's chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling, you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Speedom!

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna f*ck with the.

Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)
Speedom!
(I'mma leave 'em in the dust)

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it

Little indignity, hot diggity, this Biggie is gettin me hype.
I dont get some liquor, Ill hurt you!
Ill knock your dick in the dirt, bickerin' worse
Than that bitch in that Snicker commercial
A mixture of Stifler and Urkel, hangin from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this buildin
Cuz were tearin it down, security get out
The frickin way, Jesus Christ son the blaring is loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens goin' Eeereerreerrrerr cause

56,the hills ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32266076/Eminem/The+Hills+%5BRemix%5D,"Said you want a little company
And I love it 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be your pill re-
Fill and I’ll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills just the effects of each
Other but we gon' film 'cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?

But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time, bullshit
What your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me
But at night, if you seek those thrills what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only f*ck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge
Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only f*ck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

57,guilty conscience,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416854/Eminem/Guilty+Conscience,"Meet eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
(""s*** is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this"")

Alright, stop! (huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (but who are you?)
I'm your motherf***in conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than george burns

F*** that! do that s***! shoot that b****!
Can you afford to blow this s***? are you that rich?
Why you give a f*** if she dies? are you that b****?
Do you really think she gives a f*** if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!	(you're right!)
Not over this s*** (stop!) drop the biscuit (i will!)
Don't even listen to slim yo, he's bad for you
(you know what dre? I don't like your attitude..)

(""It's alright see'mon, just come in here for a minute"")
(""I don't know!"")
(""Look baby.."")
(""Damn!"")
(""Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?"")
(""Well ok.."")

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (""give me a kiss!"")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play... (""s***!"")

Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
And smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little b****'s earlobe..
(Yo! this girl's only fifteen years old

You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair? (uh huh!)
F*** this b**** right here on the spot bare
'Til she pa**es out and she forgot how she got there

(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _kids_?)
No, but I seen the porno with sundoobiest!
(s***, you want to get hauled off to jail?)
Man f*** that, hit that s*** raw dawg and bail..

Meet grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.

(""What the f***?!?!"")
(""Grady!!"")

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

F*** that s***, you just caught this b**** cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
F*** slittin her throat, cut this b****'s head off!!!

Wait! what if there's an explanation for this s***?
(what? she tripped? fell? landed on his dick?!)
Alright shady, maybe he's right grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay! thought about it, still want to stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes??!

What'chu say? (what's wrong?	 didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherf***er!

Uhhh-aahh! temper temper!
Mr. dre? mr. n.w.a.?
Mr. ak comin' straight outta compton why'all better make way?
How in the f*** you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw f*** it...
What am I sayin' shoot em both grady, where's your gun at?"

""Oh my"" ""We're gonna have to shock him!"" 
""Oh my God!"" ""We're gonna have to shock him!"" 
""Oh my God!"" 

These are the results of a thousand electric volts, 
A neck with bolts ""Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse!"" 
A kid who refused to respect adults, 
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose. 
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery, 
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me. 
And I might snap, one day just like that 
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack. 
My first day in junior high, this kid said, 
""Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"" 
I looked at my watch it was one twenty, 
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?"" 
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first. 
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"" 
I screamed, ""Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst! 
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"" 
""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"" 
""Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?"" 
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"" 
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over. 
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."" 
""But don't you want to give me after school detention?"" 
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your a** and I'm a let him"" 

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born 
Drugs, what they used to say I was on 
They say I never knew which way I was goin' 
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song 

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born 
Drugs, what they used to say I was on 
They say I never knew which way I was goin' 
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song 
Brain damage 

Way before my baby daughter Hailey, 
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey. 
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes, 
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers. 
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin', 
And had me in the position to beat me into submission. 
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose, 
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat. 
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef"" 
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe. 
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!"" 
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me. 
I made them think they beat me to death, 
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left. 
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth. 
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws. 
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools. 
""This is for every time you took my orange juice, 
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk. 
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt. 
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good. 
I c***ed the broomstick back and swung hard as I could, 
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood. 
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot. 
Made it home later that same day. 
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray. 
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read. 
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed. 
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?? 
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!) 
She beat me over the head with the remote control, 
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull. 
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look b****, what have you done?"" 
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you c***!"" 
I said, ""F*** it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head, 
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck. 

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born 
Drugs, what they used to say I was on 
They say I never knew which way I was goin' 
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song 

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born 
Drugs, what they used to say I was on 
They say I never knew which way I was goin' 
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

It's brain damage, 
It's probably brain damage."

In front of your optical to slow you down 

And every time you think you gotten past it 
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground 
What are friends? 
Friends are people that you think are your friends 
But they really your enemies, with secret identities 
And disguises, to hide they true colors 
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers 
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin' 

What is money? 
Money is what makes a man act funny 
Money is the root of all evil 
Money'll make them same friends come back around 
Swearing that they was always down 

What is life? 
I'm tired of life 
I'm tired of backstabbing a** snakes with friendly grins 
I'm tired of committing so many sins 
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins 
Tired of never having any ends 
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things 
I'm tired of this DJ playing your s*** when he spins 
Tired of not having a deal 
Tired of having to deal with the bulls*** without grabbing the steel 
Tired of drowning in my sorrow 
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo 
I'm tired of motherf***ers spraying s*** and dartin' off 
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour 
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off 
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough 
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk 
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk 
I'm tired of using plastic silverware 
Tired of working in Building Square 
Tired of not being a millionaire 
But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 

If I had a magic wand, 
I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, 
While I'm on the john 
If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, 
Because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor 
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store 
I'm tired of not having a phone 
Tired of not having a home 
To have one in if I did have it on 
Tired of not driving a B-M 
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him 
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M 
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum 
Tired of not being on tour 
Tired of f***ing the same blond whore 
After work in the back of a Contour 
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones 
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns 

Tired of being stared at 
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat 
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz 
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs 
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me 
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me 
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs 
Tired of J-L-be	 saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives"" 

But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john 

If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 
You know what I'm saying? 
I'm tired of all of this bulls*** 
Telling me to be positive 
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see s*** positive? 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
I rap about s*** around me, s*** I see 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Right now I'm tired of everything 
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city 
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'? 
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Just fed up 
That's my word"

Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'm a always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk

Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)

And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you want to help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
Dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson

And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad

She was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, want to ba-ba?

Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]

Just the two of us... [Repeat: x2]
And when we ride!

Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)

That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you want to help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock

Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order

No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

61,role model,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416941/Eminem/Role+Model,"Okay
I am going to attempt to drown myself 
You can try this at home 
You can be just like me 

Mic check 1, 2 
We recording?
I'm cancerous 
So when I dis you, you wouldn't want to answer this 
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus 
I strangled you to death and I choked you again 
And break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin 
You beef wit' me, I'm even the score equally 
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally 
I get too blunted off the funny home grown 
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono 
So if I said I never did drugs 
That would mean i lie and get fucked more than the President does 
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert 
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet 
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge 
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads 
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les '
Follow me and do exactly what the song says 
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people 
And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal 
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal 
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill 
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill 
'Cause I stand out like a green hat wit a orange bill 
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist 
How the f*ck can I be white, I don't even exist 
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave 
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave 
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave 
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave 

Now follow me and do exactly what you see 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D. 
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me 

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole 
When we heard a knock at the door, must of been Ron Gold 
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold 
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco 
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk 
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt 
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer 
That'll spray an Aerosol can up in the ozone layer 
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue 
Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch 
Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on 
And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn 
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits 
A premature birth that was four minutes late 
Mother are you there, I love you 
I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel 
Will someone explain to my brain 
That I just severed a main vein 
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain 
I take a breather and sigh 
Either I'm high, or I'm nuts 
'Cause if you ain't even in this room neither am I 
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass 
Then It's probably obvious that I got it on with her 
'Cause when I drop it off with this solo shit it's over with 
I bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it 

I came to the club drunk with a fake I-D 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I've been with ten women who got H-I-V 
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I tied a rope around my penis then I jumped from a tree 
You probably want to grow up and be just like me"
62,my fault,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416954/Eminem/My+Fault,"[Eminem does the voices of all characters in the song]
[G] eminem as Susan (the girl)
[D] eminem as Dave
[J] eminem as John
[R] eminem as Ron

[Chorus: x2]
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

[Eminem]
I went to john's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date

Susan... an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
Who love booze and alternative music (what-up?)
Told me she was starvin', I said it wasn't a problem (nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage

[G]
I'm allergic to fungus
Come on sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door??	pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? wasn't it yours? nuh uh
[G] 
If you got it with double mushrooms on it then I don't want it
Shut up Susan I'll pick em off it
Oh hell, I might as well try it, I'll be alright
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!

[Chorus: x2]

""Yo sue!""

[G] 
Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..

[G] 
I need to go puke!
I wasn't tryin' to turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin', I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase you and spank you with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said,

[G] 
Help me I think I'm havin' a seizure!
I said, ""you're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!""
""would you put it down you're startin' to scare me""
She said,

[G] 
I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here sue, (hi) you're talkin' to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate

[Chorus: x2]

Susan (wait!) where you goin'? you better be careful

[G] 
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin' to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin' dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
""John, where's Dave at before I bash you?""

[J] 
He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin' a crap dude!
""Dave! pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin' to plants
Choppin' her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of spring break, how long do these things take to wear off?""

[D] 
Well it depends on how many pieces she ate
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives""

[D] 
She's gonna die dude
""I know and it's my fault!""

[D] 
My god!

[Chorus: x2] 

My god, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! please wake up!! what are you doing?!
You're not dead!! you're not dead!
I know you're not dead!"

Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
Alright, turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list
You want to get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a f*ck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin', ""I suck""
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud, ""All of y'all, get the hell out now""
F*ck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D, they was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'til I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

This song is dedicated to all the happy people 
All the happy people 
That have real nice lives 

That have now idea what's it like to be broke as f*** 
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope 
Without a circus net 
I'm popping Percocet
I'm a nervous wreck 
I deserve respect 
But I'm working sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tec at somebody to reverse this debt 
Minimum wage got my adrenaline cave 
Pull the venom in rage 
Especially when I'm engaged 
And my daughters down to her last dipper 
That's got my a** hyper 
I prayed to god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer 
Watching ballers well they flossing and pathfinders 
These overnight stars become autograph signers 
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us 
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters 
Well Player haters turn a b**** like they have vagina's 
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us 
Money will brainwash and leave your a** minus 
Snakes slither in the gra** spine less 

[Chorus: x2]
That's rock bottom 
When this life makes you mad enough to kill 
That's rock bottom 
When you want something bad enough to steal 
That's rock bottom 
When you feel you have had it up to hear 
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
 
My life is full of empty promises 
And broken dreams 
I'm hopin' things look up 
But there ain't no job openings 
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, un-furnished 
I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay 
Tired of being hired and fired on the same day 
But f*** it, you know the rules to the game, play 
Cause when we die we know were all going the same way 
It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
All you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in the six 
They threw me in the mix 
With all these gloomy loony lunatics 
Walk around impressed 
And smoke a pound of sess a day 
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was yesterday 
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play 
Life half my life and throw the rest away 

[Chorus: x2]

There's people that love me and people that hate me 
But its the evil that made me this backstabber M-C called Slim Shady 
I want the money, the woman, the fortune, the fame 
Means I ain't burning in hell scorching in flames 
Means I m stealing your checkbook and forging your name 
This lifetime lives for eternal torture and pain 
Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom 
I got problems and now everybody on my block's got 'em 
I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em 
Holding two glocks, I hope your door got new locks on 'em 
My daughters feet ain't got no shoe's or sock's on 'em 
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rock's on 'em 
While you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them 
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em? 
Cause I never went gold off one song 
I'm running up on someones lawn with guns drawn

I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica.
Wait a minute. You hold it right there. Me and that woman love each other.
Love? What do you know of love?

Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger. That's not what I want to do
I love her! And we're gonna be together, never"
67,as the world turns,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416948/Eminem/As+The+World+Turns,"I don't know why this world keep turning (Yes man)
Round and round 
(As the World turns we all experience things in life)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 
(Trials and tribulations that we all must go through)
I don't know why this world keep turning 
(When someone wants to test us when someone tries our patience)
Round and round 
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 

I hang with a bunch of hippies 
And wacky tobacco planters 
Who swallow lit roaches 
And light up like jack-o-lanterns 
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts 
'cause we're dope as f*** and only get a two in the source 
They never should've booted me out of reform school 
Deformed fool, takin' a s***, in the warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn 
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!) 
It all started when my mother took my bike away 
'cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave 
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers 
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors 
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman 
F*** the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin' 
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead, 
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed 
May be true, till I told this b**** in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who me?) 
Yeah b**** you so big 
You walked into Big Panties and stepped on Jenny Craig 
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig 
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig 
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (rar!) 
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming 
Grabbed that b**** by her hair 
Drug her across the ground 
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down 
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop 
While I drop this b**** face down and watch her belly flop 

I don't know why this world keep turning (as the world turns)
Round and round 
(These are the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 
(These are the things we must go through day by day)

We drive around in million dollar sports cars 
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards 
Outsiders, and we suing the courts 
'Cause we dope as f*** and only get a two in The Source 
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat 
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blonds be at 
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage 
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park b**** 
I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya"" 
I'd like to treat ya to a bagel and a slice of pizza 
But I'm broke as f*** and I don't get paid till the first of next month 
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt 
But I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers 
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist 
So gimme all your money 
And don't try nothin' funny 
'Cause you know your stinkin' a** is too fat to try to outrun me 
I went to grab my gun 
That's when her a** put it on me 
Wit' an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry 
I fell through the glass doors 
Started causin' a scene 
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine 
Jumped up with a broken back 
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day 
And doped up off coke and smack 
All I wanted to do was rape the b**** and snatch her purse 
Now I want to kill her 
But so I gotta catch her first 
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut 
Saw the house she ran up in 
And shot her f***in' porch up 
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut 
Looked around the room 
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut 
I know you're in there b****! I got my gun c***ed! 
You might as well come out now 
She said ""Come in, its unlocked!"" 
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne 
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn 
She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"" 
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it 
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her 
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her 
I started to beg ""No, please let go"" 
But she swallowed my f***in' leg whole like an egg roll 
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled 
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple 
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick 
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick! 
Whipped that s*** out, and ain't no doubt about it 
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage 
I shouted ""Now b****, lets see who gets the best!"" 
Stuffed that s*** in crooked and f***ed that fat slut to death (Ah! ah!) 

Come here b****! 
Come here! 
Take this motherf***in' dick! 
B****, come here! 

I don't know why this world keep turning 
(And as we go along)
Round and round 
(Throughout the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 
(We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday)
I don't know why this world keep turning 
(That we must go through)
Round and round 
(These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 

I don't know why this world keep turning 
(Every day every single day the world keeps turning)
Round and round"
68,im shady,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416947/Eminem/Im+Shady,"Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, ""F*ck the world!""
(I'm Slim Shady) so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot (uh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'm a come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

I like happy things,
I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things
That make me happy and gleeful (he he he)
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hm)
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)

How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
So bring the money by tonight, cause your wife
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a f*ck you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Aw that shit is wack!)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
(What? That's my shit!)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So f*ck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)
And if I told you I had aid y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack (uh-uh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uh)
She's still alive and bitchin' (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being aids infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

(Ha ha ha ha)
I told you I was Shady!
(Ha ha)

Y'all didn't wanna believe me!
I'm Shady!
And that's my name"
69,bad meets evil,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416946/Eminem/Bad+Meets+Evil,"I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts 
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon 
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over 
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em 
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen 
Got murdered in cold blood 
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home 
They say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern 
And on a quiet night 
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet 
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat 
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head 
Trapped him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed 
Til' the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
Told him each one of his boys is dead 
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said 

Who hard? yo I done heard worse 
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
To see which one will swerve first 
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds 
That of a globe, on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil 
Intelligence level is 'hell-ier' than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto 
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist 
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse 
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse 
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations 
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
We hit the trees til' we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal 
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either 
(s***, me neither) 
We ain't eager to be legal 
So please leave me wi't the keys to your Jeep Eagle 
I breathe ether in three amounts 
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle 
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain (He's insane) 
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off 
'Cause I can't find a decent vain 

The disaster wit' dreads 
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough 
To kill my soul after I'm dead 
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 
'Cause I serve any stranger wit' money 
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains 
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches 
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral 
Service lobby, strangle your body to confirm you 
Whippin' human a**, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws 
Wit' my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and gla** 
I'm blazin' M-C's, at the same time amazin' M-C's 
Somehow M-C's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me 
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche 
And bust till volcanoes erupt 

Hello? (Billy) 
Ah-yo what's up (we're comin' to get you) 
Stop they know it's us! 

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah) 
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh) 
Well I'm out now (s***)
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up 
And I ain't goin' leave you a window to jump out of 
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms 
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms 
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave 
I'm a put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal 
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel 

(We'll be waitin') 
See you in hell 
Wall Street, 
Royce Da 5'9, Slim Shady 
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye) 
Bad meets evil, what? (till next time)

And so that's the story when bad meets evil 
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens 
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did 
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon 
But their spirits still live on til' this day 
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?"

Brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady
(Tell 'em I don't give a f*ck)
Slim shady does not give a f*ck, what you think?
(Tell 'em to suck it)

If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know, upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)

Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you
(Yeah)
Anything else?
Yeah, sue me"
71,kill you,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416939/Eminem/Kill+You,"When I was just a little baby boy
My Mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my Daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin', I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?

Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
F*ck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again

You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal' ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
F*ck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
F*ck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor

From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said, ""Shut up"", when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you"
72,stan,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416862/Eminem/Stan,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, f*ck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk 'bout you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim (shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!)
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit just clownin', dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!"

(I never knew I)
Mic check, one two
(I never knew I)
Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I)
Who'da known?
(I never knew I)

F*ck, what a story
(I never knew I)
Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I)
And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk, when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the f*ck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn 'em around

Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
F*ck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me, when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin, ""Go"", with their seventeen year old uncle
I'm like, ""Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked, if they liked violence?""

And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow, your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me, that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And 'F*ck' was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird

So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch, I never knew I'd

Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
F*ck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me?
And run up in the school shootin'
When they're pissed at a teach

Her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist

How the f*ck was I supposed to know?"

It's ridiculous! I can't believe it! ! 
Hold on, em
What up? 
Have a seat? Dre, I'll call you back
What now? 
I don't even know where to start
Okay
I got the album from upstairs
And
And this is by far, the most,

Incredible thing, I've ever heard"
75,the way i am,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416864/Eminem/The+Way+I+Am,"Man, whatever
Dre just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone
F*ck it, just shut up and listen, ayo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this—on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a f*ck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am"
76,real slim shady,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416856/Eminem/Real+Slim+Shady,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so f*ck him and f*ck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a f*ck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I’m high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

For this one, they scream ""X, you retarded?!""
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term “universal,” without no rehearsal
I leak words that’s controversial
Like I’m not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I’ll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin’ through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like “No! No! No!!!”
Life’s a bitch, met her, f*ck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it’s all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I’m the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can’t-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin’ he ain’t a killer, but I’m killin’ myself
Smoke death, f*ck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I’ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who’d do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we’ll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I’m gettin’ wires, niggas wantin’ me dead
Wantin’ my head, you think it could be somethin’ I said?

Remember me? I just don’t give a f*ck!
Remember me? Yeah, f*ck you too!
Remember me? I’m low down and I’m shifty!
Remember me? I’m Shady!

When I go out, I’ma go out shootin’
I don’t mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I’m tryin’ to clean up my fuckin’ image
So I promised the fuckin’ critics
I wouldn’t say “fuckin’” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on!
My baby’s mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin’ these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I’m stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she’s on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16’s and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint’s speech to fix these streets?!
F*ck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match!
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat! Show ’em where it’s at!
(What the f*ck you starin’ at, nigga?!)

Don't you remember me?
Remember me? Remember me?
Remember me? (Slim Shady!)"
78,marshall mathers,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416930/Eminem/Marshall+Mathers,"You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em something
The f*ck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the f*ck outta here!

You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a f*ck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him ‘cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

The New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it

Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (ha-ha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear
In faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns ‘cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the f*ck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go f*ck Puffy!
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the f*ck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Um, here, ""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aww, f*ck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a f*ck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a f*ck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth

Guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in a minute
Ayo...this is my love song...it goes like this

Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to get the party start
We used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
And when it kicks in, you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and probably barf
And my prediction is you're probably fall
Either in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything spinning 
You're beginnin' to think like a woman
Are swimming in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it,and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a forty-two-car pileup
Earth calling pilot to copilot
Looking for life on this planet,sir, no sigh of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might dieif go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in outer spacei've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Some geek keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't want to, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them"

Throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits
'Til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious

Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw
Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way

Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast

Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage
With ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aww, naww, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, (What?) dick six inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (a .44)

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

82,kim,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416925/Eminem/Kim,"Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again
I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?!
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the f*ck up! (You're drunk!
You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a f*ck?!
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me, Kim! You really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a -year-old little 
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me!
What the f*ck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
F*ck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the f*ck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the f*ck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the f*ck could you do this to me?!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!
Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!
Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!) F*ck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm crackin' up, get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!) So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only makin' this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah, somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the f*ck up and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you"
83,under the influence,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416924/Eminem/Under+The+Influence,"So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the f*ck outta everything I come across in the halls

I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators

My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me

I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a f*ck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron

I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)

I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats

Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets,ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's

Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums

I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it

I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys

If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order

I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run

Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a f*ck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady"
84,criminal,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416923/Eminem/Criminal,"A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on records
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do it in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why? 'cause I'm a

Criminal
Criminal
You goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's, ""Yes""
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin'
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get a hold of 'em

Hey, it's me, Versace
Whops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it? Checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an Amen
Amen
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons

Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
Who?
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. ""Don't Give A F*ck"" still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme

I guess I'm a criminal
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the f*ck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink malt liquor to f*ck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna f*ck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went when the president got oral sex
In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white
Blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
The maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look
Uh huh
Just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money
And get the f*ck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you
Aight
Yo, Em
What?
Don't kill nobody this time
Aw right, goddamn, f*ck

Hi
How you doin'?
How can I help you?
Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag, bitch
And I won't kill you
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Just don't kill me, I have two kids at home
I said, I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
Don't kill me
Hurry the f*ck up
Thank you

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a f*ck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme

86,white america,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416921/Eminem/White+America,"America! We love you! 
How many people are proud 
to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? 
The stripes and the stars for the rights 
that men have died for to protect 
The women and men who have broke their necks 
for the freedom of speech 
The United States government has sworn to uphold. 
(Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) 
or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, 
So many motherf***in' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs, 
It's like a f***in' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed 
in no particular direction, 
Just sprays and sprays 
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays, 
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought, 
standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide, 
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear 
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? 
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office, 
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, 
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled s*** all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

[Chorus]
White America! 
I could be one of your kids,
white America!
little Eric looks just like this,
White America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get, 
white America!
I Could be one of your kids, 
white America!
little Eric looks just like this, 
white America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ya'self
If they were brown
Shady lose 
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so f*** school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the f***in' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a f*** I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like ""F*** it""
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his a**
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this s*** wow
I'm like ""My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?""

[Chorus]

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthaf***in' turbulance
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like 
""I dont like this, no!""
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a b**** and say fagot
S***,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthaf***in' spokesman now for

[Chorus]

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
F*** you Ms. Cheney
F*** you tipper Gore
F*** you with the freeness of speech this 
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
F*** you!

Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you"
87,cleanin out my closet,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416853/Eminem/Cleanin+Out+My+Closet,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show""

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet"

And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance, 
Aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw

C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back. 
Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration, 
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like, 
This white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt, 
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, 
Won't go nowhere, do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there, go to Beirut and do a show there
Yah you laugh till your muthaf***in' a** gets drafted, 
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
Till you f*** around, get an anthrax napkin, 
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping, 
F***in' a**a**ins hijackin' Amtracks crashin'
All this terror America demands action, 
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's a** askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy. 
You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans. 
I'm twenty-eight, they're gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy? When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait, 
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me, 
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully, 
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic, hypnotic product I got it the antibiotic, 
Ain't nobody hotter and so on
And yada yada, god I talk a lotta hem de lay la la la, 
Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make, 
Keep makin' new s***, 
Produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me? 
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege, somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry, like a f***in' younger me, f*** the fee, 
I can get you jumped for free
Yah buddy, laugh it's funny, 
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pa** the K-why, 
Let's get ready for some intense, serious a** f***ing!

C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me
Cana-b****, won't square dance with me
Fan-a-b****, won't square dance with me
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen, wants to square dance with you
Yee-Haw!"
