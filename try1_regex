Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahaha

F*ck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, f*ck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady with rabies

I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school, ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, it's a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

F*ck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, f*ck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (doot, doot, doot) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place, but if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked, you gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

F*ck rap, bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, f*ck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like Jay-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed now, chicka-chicka-chicka, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered

Hold up, I said Rover because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (roof) like the doberman said
I still think the (roof) would go over your head (haha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit with so many foul lines
You think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best? I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though, 'cause MC's know

But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
And you're trapped in your cell phone
On my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't want to fuckin' listen to you spit your rap someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mil'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular f*ck, like f*ck rap

I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With the Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug it, fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare knuckle it, nah, f*ck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket, abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, f*ck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while you panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagan's, tryin' to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this stand up banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floor boards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins, lapkins and chapki
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm papkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flammina babbita playin' a jampkin
Dammit, a can of pa",0

Wife beaters in the winter, damn
Uh, shit

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

Yo, yo, aw, man
Yo, word to the titles
So word to my idols and word to the goats (Uh)
I ain't sayin' I like 'em
I'd kill all them niggas and wear 'em as coats (Uh)
Word to the feelings I channel
I lose 'em as quick as a fuckin' remote (Uh)
Don't be callin' me woke (No)
I cheat on my queen for a hoe
That's how shit go, she keep sayin' we chill (Ayy)
She gon' come out her shell (Woah)
Ain't no pushin' my buttons
When all of my feelings is stuck on a wheel (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm thirsty and blessed (Ayy)
I pour liquor in grills (Woah)
This for my niggas in jail, wrestlin' L's (Uh)
That's that hell in the cell
I come from a place where the shit can get shady
My chances was slim (Ayy)
All my women was basic
We see different races since signing to him (Yeah)
I can't send out no message to none of my exes
And bitches as friends (Ayy)
I can't blow it again
Need a bitch that's as thick as my skin, shit 'cause

I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

I left my legacy hurt? Fuckin' absurd
Like a shepherd havin' sex with his sheep, f*ck what you heard
All this talk in my ear, I got a idea
Like the clerk when you tryna buy beer (ID ya)
Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare
F*ck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye
I got the bottle of NyQuil right here (Right here)
You want the sleep me to wake, you want Slim Shady EP
That's on the CD cover, sockin' my mirror (Sockin' my mirror)
I promise not to cry crocodile tears (Crocodile tears)
If you end up shocked at my lyrics (Shocked at my lyrics)
Marshall is dead in the water, but not that I care
Dre said, ""Rock the boat"" and the Doc is my pier
So, it's unanimous, you're at attention, the planet's listenin'
And their banana splits again, which has its advantages
But when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickenson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture, then ripped it in half
And whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many rounds or if I get knocked down
In a bout and fell to the ground
I got a fighter's mentality, I'll get back up and fight with it
In fact, I'ma attackin' the mic with it
I'll make it sound (Sound) like a vampire's bitin' it
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick (Sidekick)
To be down for the count (Haha), yeah
Yo, album's (What?), out (Yeah), now (Uh)
Pow (Pow), wow (Woo), I don't (Huh), see no (Uh) clouds (Nah)
But ain't gon' (No) be no (Huh) drought (Uh-uh)
Smile (No), frown (Yeah), upside (Ah) down (Ya)
Shut my (Nope) mouth (Yeah), how? (How)
That ain't what (What) I'm 'bout
Shout (Shout), showers (F*ck it, ow, ow)
Thug it out (Ow), 'cause

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just hope I never, damn (I just hope I never)
I just pray I never, f*ck (I just pray I never)
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Rainy days, uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Hang today, uh)
I need changes in a major way, a way (Major way, uh)

2,remember the name,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36259009/Eminem/Remember+the+Name,"Yeah, I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin'"", like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey

I can still remember (what), tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (yeah)
became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (what) if I'd prevail (huh)
And all I did was (what) put Nine Inch Nails (where)
In my eyelids now (what), I'm seein' diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means, if rap was skinny jeans
I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splittin' seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means no if, ands, or buts, are squeezin' in-between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fucking living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me
I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean (ow!)
Shinin' wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, that shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king, bring me fifty bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to get super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey (ow!)",0
3,hip hop,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36584804/Eminem/Hip+Hop,"Yeah huh
(hip hop hip hop hip hop)
Turn the mic up a little bit
(hip hop)
Get some of this Cali weedo
(hip hop)
Listen to some motherfuckin'
(hip hop)
Haha
(Sounds like gold, sounds like street, whoo
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C)

Hip hop, (hip hop) That's the way of life
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab the pen and pad, and start to jot some
Always told myself, that I would never be losin
Man, I ain't have no hood, my mother was always movin
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn, mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step-dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, then the force got stronger
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is hip hop (hip hop)
Man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi! ""What up?"" Give me a beat box
(beatbox)

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop (hip)
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, (whoo)
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

From the hip hop Shop to Maurice Malone
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore (D12!)
Hell yeah, I looked in my car
Bitch, I was homeless, I slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas had to do what's best, it was a mess
All them taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't by an ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go the car and get them things
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the Beastie Boys
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and the niggas in the club
To the E Dubbs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come
{gun sprays}

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop (hip)
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, (whoo)
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, and I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff to Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seeger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun, I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryna let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughin' cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thing
I used to have this theory, keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no C-C-W license
I tried to apply for one, they said it take 5-6 months
What the f*ck am I supposed to do meanwhile when rivals come?
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple-platinum, I ain't tryna catch no murder 1
Figured I'd shoot the womb, probably missin' at least one
But the other one's f*ck his shoulder and his knee cap up
And I'm a say for self-defense how come I had the gun
Is because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'll get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to
Havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded
Once I got and I thank God it was empty the night I got caught with it
What the f*ck man, I thought that it was supposed to be

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop (hip)
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, (whoo)
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the MPC",0
4,caterpillar,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35019312/Eminem/Caterpillar,"You will not be able to stay home brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on scag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar keeps firing
Oh, we in the war
Where butterflies keep dyin' (ah)

I'm a product of Parker, Lewis and Kubiak
If didn't do this, where in the f*ck would you be at?
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lion and sip hyenas
You number one when it comes to slaughtered mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uh, all you niggas my lil' rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rapper, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets, I switch into so many different passions
I'm skippin' class to be fascinating
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit's just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I just decapitate him
Out here congratulating these has-beens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I'll bring adequate to these patterns and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, the caterpillar is firing
Oh, we in the war
Where butterflies keep dyin' (ah)

This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one

Here take your number one, quit
Number one soul, get your number one chip
Number one fly with your number one kicks
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do
Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you gas you up
And tell you somethin' you never knew
Always stay professional
You always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold on to what we're retracting to
I do what I want to do, they do what I let them do
Everything niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie
There is nothing I can say to you that is good
Remember when you raisin' the butterfly
Don't you ever fucking disrespect the caterpillar

This right here for the number ones
Number ones here with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now everybody sayin' that they number one
Here take your number one, quit
Number one soul, get your number one chip
Number one fly with your number one kicks
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

You lookin at Atilla
The psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper isn't even half as ill
A savage still, the tracks a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'
Like Anderson Silva when he snapped his shin in half 
And then had shit hangin' by a flap of skin 
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I’m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot
You copy me, but you're not
You can't be butterflies
My offspring's are just moths
If I see that thing, I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall, set the sprinklers off
Like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah, 'til the shingles come off the roof
We'll shatter the ceilings
Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot
A singular thought I'd think I would help you distinguish
A brother from the cream of the crop
Wait a minute, hold up
Like a flash card
Damn dog, is that copyin', or payin' homage?
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather
I have to rehatch on you
Come back as black wasp
Half yellow jacket, you can't swat a
Sasquatch dancin' on top of a Ant, 
Trample it and stomp it, smash it and stand on it
Dammit, I can't stop it
The rap is a vag and I can't stop goin' in like a tampon in this bitch
It's is manslaughter
Stampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods
In fact you're exact opposites
You make a wack song, and can't hold a candle
But even Daniel-san wax off, you jack-offs
Need to come to grips, like a hand job
The boom bap is back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number two 'cause that's all I do with 'em
Poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I droppin' a deuce and
When I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen them
Bitch it is real like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon 
And I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb and I'm bustin' you",0
5,the ringer,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368569/Eminem/The+Ringer,"Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts 
And see where this takes me, 
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the f*ck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the f*ck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause 
I just don't get what the f*ck half the shit is that you're listening to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil' Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna f*ck on my bitch? 
(F*ck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll just turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the f*ck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us?"" (Ooh-ooh)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'Zae
Lil' Pump, Lil' Xan imitate Lil' Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the f*ck are you gonna do? Where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached, my enemies die
I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date,"" ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, Mookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners",0
6,greatest,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368568/Eminem/Greatest,"Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah), sayin' I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin' tell them make me (bitch), eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo), wanna be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who made it, it's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Steven Paddock with automatic stay spray
At anything that may stand in their way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan tasks cam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs
Ain't givin' ways ankle the ways you chumps don't
Even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someone a lump in their throat
If you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
Then you better take it back to the shelter
And Hamburger Helper, 'cause damn it I'm still the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way I misprounouced a name
""DIE ANTWOORD!""
F*ck, I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the f*ck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs to let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout, now get the f*ck out my rhyme book!
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' everyone up in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
best to ever do it, best to ever do it, best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest

Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
F*ck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the SIG lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly, I'ma sting like a bee, you ain't harmin' a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I know one day I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
best to ever do it, best to ever do it, best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?

7,lucky you,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368567/Eminem/Lucky+You,"Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
F*ck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
F*ck you too, woah!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't f*ck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not f*ck with you guys
If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangin'
Some chains and some blades in and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just drop four like an Uno
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto
Lookin' for something that prolly can never find out
Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now
What you would nigga? You really want me tied down
I've been alone, I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower

I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
F*ck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, f*ck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
F*ck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the f*ck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And f*ck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps, let's recap
Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks
Eight DATs with the G raps and Kane's hat
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
That you're a button to press or a lever to pull
They give me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'ma sleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker never got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ay
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a writer might've fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",0

The album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made

10,normal,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368565/Eminem/Normal,"Yo, how do I keep
(I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, told her why I'm soulless, she's

Heartless, no wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger

She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun'
We over but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the f*ck did I get so twisted?
I picked someone that's so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seein'
She's only mine for the time bein'
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hoppin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the f*ck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo
Flip me off right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?
Yeah, I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?",0

13,stepping stone,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368563/Eminem/Stepping+Stone,"It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof, wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is clear

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Bacardi in hand, never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift, all the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words

But I guess they're just honored for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to but I'm fighting for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm under the sink, but it was not my intent

To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road, done all we possibly can
I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones",0

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (woah)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spider move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We can not give a f*ck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya, it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggas

Brain dead, eye drops
Pain meds, cyclops
They bed, iPod
Maybach, my bach
Trainwrecks, sidewalks
Pay less, high-tops
K-fed, iHop
Playtex, icebox
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us 

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ayy)
The people you run with are thuggin' (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, in other words if you're a Gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and f*ck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
His tough demeanor, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne 
If you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you but you already know who the f*ck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as f*ck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, rarely but this time Shady 
'Bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy
Cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and I told him 
The moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein, a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is Groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Rolex to Goldman and I'm throat-sprayin' tryna throw to Nicole
They both hate to choke and my whole plate is chokin'
And I double-edge sworded 'cause one place 
I poke and I stick and I turn and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle 
Of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formidable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nuttin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One month older
Sponge, mob, colder
Nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster
Lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah)
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (woo!)

Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, welp (fack, fack)

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I tea-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I am the fucking pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, fack 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here
Serial killin' every beat there is, but wait

Wait, got the eeriest feelin', somethin' evil is lurkin'
I'm no conspiracy theorist but somethin' here is a foot
Oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (what?)
Twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
Other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

16,fall,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35378067/Eminem/Fall,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre in that first marijuana tape
Guess I got a chronic case
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I've forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlemagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mocking Jay
Next minute, they get they style from Migos, then they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted, Shady? You got it!

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Line 'em up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Rrr
Don't fall on my fate
Look

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted 
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spit like this in his last shit""
Hoe, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it traps 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up""
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
Slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot a head (pew)
Gabby Gifford, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sac-rilegious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is 
To help you put together some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
Like the feature when I stole this show
Sorry if I took forever

Don't fall on my face
Yeah
Don't fall on my faith, oh
I won't
Don't fall on my fate
Light him up!
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Ha
Don't fall on my fate
It's too easy

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detract this, I might have to f*ck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, unleash the monster
Then tell the Grammys to go and f*ck themselves 
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em
See the show, every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary 
In my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists
On the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly 
And what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 
'Cause I'm barely gettin' started
And as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own
Brush my pelvic bone
You should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown!
Don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, 
The Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat 
Piss and moan, but I'm not gonna fall, bitch!

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it

Suck my dick, you fucking suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fucking suck man

I hop in your whip and take a sip then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin'
I don't, I don't got much self control, I hope that you run it
I'm not a cheater, but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes
But females be rushin' me outside my tele, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice

You're such a nice guy, a nice guy

You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La proxima yo se que mejor me quedo sola
Estas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola
I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks
You hope that I choke on a Pepsi
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
F*ck you going in those knee high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say ""Don't come over"" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing
Why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing by",0
18,good guy,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35368558/Eminem/Good+Guy,"Here we go, again, from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?
Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for
When you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass
When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the date
I can hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him""
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core
But the pain I'm in, after you I swore
To make the gray skies ene
Here comes the rays like wind
You get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or?
Do I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream ""F*ck you""
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in

Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
Can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
Play like you're the good guy, play like, play like
Play like you're the good guy",0

Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin'
Into ya, look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the f*ck's happened
End of ya, when you're bit with the

Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

I said, ""Knock knock, let the devil in, alien""
E-E-Elliot phone home, ain't no telling when this choke hold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, double-aught, Buckshot
Tied her up to a garrote
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the f*ck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me

Venom

Shut the f*ck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
F*ck, your beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, you weird beard
We doin' this once
Your beard's weird, why you yellin' at the mic?

Rihanna just hit me on the text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me, I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next, damn
I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my Nordic Track
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (Slim you're old)
Ow, Kelly, ooh, but I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29 I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gun, I bet you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still
Are you eating cereal, or oatmeal?
What the f*ck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
Dictionary
Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery, oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops, know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?
Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you're the whack me
It's funny, but so true
I'd rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you
'Til I'm hitting old-aged still can fill a whole page with a 10 year old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy
Go play, feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailey in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (the f*ck?)
Bein' rich, aimed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim, yeah, bitch, pop champagne to this
It's your moment, this is it
As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort, but if I was three
Foot 11, you'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be this solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what fuckin' good is a machine gun when it's out of ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the f*ck can him and I battle?
He'll have to f*ck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write, Not Alike
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it, Kells?
Attempt fails, Budden, L's
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' whack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' AutoTune, so let's talk about it (let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it before we can even talk about it (talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth, and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin', oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy, you know I love you",0

Another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this
World has come to, it's blowin' up
And this whole country is goin' nuts
And the NRA is in our way
They're responsible for this whole production
They hold the strings to control the puppets
And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin'
And no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
Their loaded weapons
They love their guns more than our children
Shh, think another one just entered in our buildin'
And we'll be

Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
F*ck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin' me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn't scaring us, we pass
Knowing we're fearless, 'cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah (we don't give a no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
F*ck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
Goin' nowhere fast

F*ck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year-old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways, for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin' we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch f*ck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah (we don't give a, no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
F*ck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no, goin' no
Goin' nowhere (we're on the run of our lives)
Going nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other
When we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh-oh
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is

Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're)
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a, no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
F*ck doin' what you're told (what we're told)

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also someone's wife
So time we spend is borrowed
It's our moment, right here, f*ck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear all
Nice and easy as hair, when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle

She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, ""All that old school hip-hop is so fucked
Think that shit's got pneumonia""
I told her, ""Bitch now, just hold up""
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need Q-Tip for the culture

Speed it up a little bit
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the motherfucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we renovate
And re-develop hella weights, and I'ma get a special place, now
Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind, I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you're fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of f*ck it
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me, duck it
Let me keep it one hundred, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)

Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet isn't it?
I really, really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing
A song like this that I could sing for you
All the feels you make me do
A nightmare fucking coming true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house, take your shoes, take your heart

Now here comes that singing part
I'm daydreaming
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (get you) or how I'll make you pay
Babe, I'm hurtin' (hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same
That's my plan (that's my plan)
That's my plan
That's my plan

We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge, revenge
Together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Now here's where girlfriends come in hand
Especially those that understand
Crime's a crime but listen man
Really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing
Say the word we make it sting for him
He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye you piece of shit
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it

Here comes that singing part

Well, in the beginning we felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee, but hell with any injury
Eventually you'll get up gingerly
It feels like it'll take a century to heal, but just know that I will
But f*ck trying to make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz with all your lady friends, whores 
Hit the club and you go out don't know a sum
'Cause when I calculate the times you cheated and total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up 'cause you say that just giving out your number doesn't count (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new get mad and flip it look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it (stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it)
Slut! 
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me while I'm driving to hers
Just remember
You cheated on me first
You're a whore, you're a whore
This is war

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you

Marshall!

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?

Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?

But no beef

I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who want to die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't want to hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the F*CK?! (Who the F*CK?!) you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!

[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - see'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ""Ether""
(Not) I shoulda crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man.. {*scratched* - ""Watch your fuckin mouth""}

27,the real slim shady,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34672970/Eminem/The+Real+Slim+Shady,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so f*ck him and f*ck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a f*ck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? Gotta break it
Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors

I'm about getting the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rolling a seven, when I toss up the dice
I'm about getting my logo off, flooded with ice
I'm about taking a risk, that might f*ck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like ""niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too""
Thought I had the Midas touch
And then I went platinum too
Mother f*ck all your comparisons
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
So He must be hearing shit
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Others get the hit with the laugh
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
So you know where I came from
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
Connected to a higher power
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stopping like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T.
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors

If she was flavor I won't savor
No taste buds, hoe later
F*ck you looking at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And f*ck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin ‘em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"", pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
Cause I'ma—

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from em, no favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? no favors

29,believe,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675916/Eminem/Believe,"And I started from the bottom, like a
Snowman, ground up, like round chuck 
And still put hands on you, stayin' wound up
That's how I spin time, sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes
I just got that air about me, like wind chimes
Another day in the life, used to have to scrape to get by
Now my community is gated and I made it and my neighbors say hi
I'm givin' em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days off
Minimum wage for, general labor
Welfare recipient as a minor
Look for government assistance has made you
Adversity if at first shit don't succeed
Put your temper to more use 'cause being broke is a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, got it's like a, almost
Got it, but close only counts in time bombs and horse shoes
So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick)
No remorse
Screw it, I'm lit, and that's the attitude I blew up on
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done, nah, bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe
In me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
Do you still believe? I'll never quit
In me?

Man I know some times these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me, there's just ink blots
I just fling them like slingshots, and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef can at least cost you your career
Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger is free as a bird
New warhead-ed birth, you just forehead-ed on earth
Too short for a verse, studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate america
Stick a fork in it and turn
'Cause four letter words are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
You're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consulting when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the tunnel so people are always looking at me when they're going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" when I was having trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
I'm going to get you jacked up, like you're trying to fix a flat (uh)
When you struggle with a spare
That double fisted bear, knuckles coupled with the spare
Nuts, I'm cuppin' I am your f*ck it switch nothing can compare

Do you still believe
In me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
Do you still believe? I'll never quit
In me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe, and smoke that
But my battery is low
I'm gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof on my back
I called you a groupie cause I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm calling on you 'cause I think I'm slowly
Startin' to lose faith in it so, give me that inkling and
Motivation to go, who's insane with the flow
Fake fans with the two faced that show
Let heartbeat produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose chains
'Cause all I dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginning
So that goes for you too
So what the f*ck you gon' do, use the tools you're given
Or are you going to use the cards you were dealt as an excuse to not do shit with them
I used to play the loser victim
Until I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stack decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I run in place while this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pains when you've won the race
When that pool of exhaust is cooling off
'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove at all
'Cause you already hit them with the coup de gras
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with that Bruce Will
It's that blue steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose I won't loose will

Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it’s no use
We ain’t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the f*ck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar

White boy, white boy, in your cop car

Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a (big rockstar)

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to f*ck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops f*ck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up’s the only time attention’s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can’t escape the sirens
Don’t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate’s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we’re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil’s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we’re guilty ‘cause we’re black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
Single mother strugglin’ through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
F*ck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the f*ck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build",0

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his next grasp to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress less, mismatch
On his breast jackets is sex addict
And cheaters want to egg sack it for being checked, get back
It's a chest match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't f*ck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knifing hands, says the relationship hanging by a strip
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to Spiderman
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said ""Bye Suzanne"" after the first night, but tonight I am

It was cold, some lights gram

'Cause he left, so what? He did adverse to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and suited
When it's too hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in cursin' to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just still like the person who I'm turnin' into
Irreversible, I pray for you like a church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soap box and breach, my sermon in speech
Detergent and bleach is burned in the womb
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this bullshit in new
To use protection 'fore I pity to your forbidden crew, f*ck

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (ooh)
My name's (ooh)
Denver, never run
Call me (ooh)
Call me (ooh)
River (ooh)
We'll let the river run

Always the bride's maid, never ""The bride, hey!""
What can I say? If life was a highway
The sequels are non-clay
But be swerving in side lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice maybe
That's why I'm made, that came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight, what I made you
Terminate my baby
This love triangle, left us in a rectangle
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
That I really woulda' loved your smile
Didn't really want to abort
But f*ck it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

Body's bananas and sass to go wit'
I spot you at first glance and go, ""shit""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That part won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate

That's why I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight, too (yo)
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear, like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Bean
I'm thinkin' soon as trampolines so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten, so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the diamonds and the jukebox
Two shots, a blue hypnotic and soon I
Turn this brooha to a barroom brawl
So hit smash on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)

(Say can I take you home, where we can be alone?)
Shawty, you the shit
Girl, I order you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides ya (I love)
Like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides, hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl, you're so fucking fly
You belong in the mile high club
So come on baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high strung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' for, we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing' a light bulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim, and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda
But

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)",0
33,revival ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675910/Eminem/Revival+%28Interlude%29,"I've drowned and high from the ashes now
I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything, I'll grasp at ends
Or what's left over
And the lights in every broken, blown out window
Screaming, laughing
I like to feel it coursing out
This is our revival",0
34,bad husband,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675908/Eminem/Bad+Husband,"We never saw from each other's sides
Or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news
Love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun
Actually used to run
Back to the booth
Jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue
Lash out on you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb
Stone it was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once
And that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because

How come you can be a low illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailey
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod
When my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks
In that tiny box
When we tied the knot
When we broke the knot
Every line we crossed
We were supposed to not
Every time we fought
Being souls they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we could've read
Which maybe would've lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I said I wasn't sitting here asking myself

How come you can be a low illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
There's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now
And all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us to not hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard mockingbird
And got the urge to jot me some verses
And thoughts the purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused a few, and so have you
Or argue who's fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine
But really no ones, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh f*ck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We was so nuts, back stab each other, another blow struck
But there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over
And it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people could be so good at one thing 
And so fucked at a whole 'nother shit it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
There's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband",0
35,tragic endings,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675907/Eminem/Tragic+Endings,"I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to f*ck it up again
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

All my life, I was told
I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it
Every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot the hell up
I'm fallin' helplessly, I'm embarrassed
And I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit
Every time she yells at me
Selfishly indeed
Definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip
Now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms
I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string
She lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain
But I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me
My friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious
And enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture
When she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her
In this war
When she gets going, she don't stop
When I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her
It was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton
Of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground
For me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it
When I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the f*ck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

It took a while for me to get it
But I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna
See me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy
Destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces
Brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me
Get this straight, then say ""screw her""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick
I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door
So here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light now, I'm running to it
What the f*ck? Should've knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings",0
36,framed,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675906/Eminem/Framed,"Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's
Freaky tales (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking, but I wanna stick her like she decals
But when murdering females, better pay attention to these details
Or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a f*ck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities bursting outta me, please, beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs""
Chop her up, put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's trailer
And leave 'em there

But, hey, man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew something was wrong
Think I'm becoming monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But, dog, how the f*ck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it, to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond
'Cause it's incumbent upon
Me, plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl
The motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collecting newspaper articles, cutting up seconds from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper cut my public defender's
Jugular, then stuck up in the blender
Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

But, hey, man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap looking like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen, for raping eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked when I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen, I lay in wait, adjacent facing the door remaining patient
While staying complacent, blatant 
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow, in hopes that when you get home
You'll get the hint ho, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me
I could describe a murder scene in a verse
And be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly 
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary

No officer, you see I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed",0
37,heat,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675904/Eminem/Heat,"Wanna take it from the top?

Lady you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you can set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you I actually said to myself, ""I gotta meet her like a taxi""
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
You sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camero
I'm tryin' to catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the meow, hope it's not a problem in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this bomb in your cap
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following back
About six cars, I'm in the Lak
And I want to

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the connivence store
But those jeans you wore, I've never seen before
I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
Pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (yo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror, she's rapping my shit
But she wasn't aware, I was there, or maybe she was, and just did't care
Who knows, at least that ain't up in the air
It's something to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But f*ck the Pepe Le Pu shit
""Ain't stepping to you bitch"", I say to myself
Plus she's bumping my music, and chasing no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her, to some degree
And f*ck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
F*ck it, pull up beside her
Side swipe her, Dodge Viper
Wood is upright I asked if she wants a computer lodged up her vagina
Said my dick is an Apple
She said ""put it inside her""
I said

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
'Cause it just died like ""ooh, food coloring, duh""
So let's get turnt, like a shish kebob, twist it Ma
Like an air conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water, I bet you get yourself a steam
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner
You got puns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of Ds
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred me in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle finger, to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you saw you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm want it

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Under ones and twos, to three or four in the morning
Rick's for the cut like Neosporin (what)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand

Who the f*ck, it's my big dick, so everybody get ready right fucking now",0
38,offended,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675903/Eminem/Offended,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shotty entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'""
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
But 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald
Shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her
While I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the Xanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll, a Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled, (Em) so's my manager
Bitch I'm amateur, f*ck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push in to kaputt you when I
Pull 'em like, sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
And I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a 10, you're an 8
Like what I do before, after, and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees
It's the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like lodi partner, blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get to soakin', try to get to poke the hole in
While you hose me off, and nope I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
I got a lotta more
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head, I never hunted for the bread
And what I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply
Because, I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds",0

I always find you like this

What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile, as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what wouldn't I do for you

And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

I'm starting to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raising the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults and there's no excuse for the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's?
No, you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her, 'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Now her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble, she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian River 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I have a shit-eating grin when I smile
Making an excuse for her, start actin' out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief
I don't believe in going to bed mad
I keep on trying to make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times
And bad, I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead
'Cause I literally feel like you could die of a ""should I?""
Leave me for good? You never would
Now it'd be your bad
Never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person, too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep putting my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
I'm in trouble but I can't leave
I'd sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you
What is that?
I'm co-dependent
I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it
Nor the heart, our apartment's tore apart
You're using my heart for a dart board
But God must've found stars for us 'cause somebody paired us up
And they say he ain't capable of making a mistake
But this one's perfect 'cause I'm

I'm starting to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packing up my shit
As much shit in the car as I can fit 
And I'm just driving as far as I can get
Away from these problems, 'til all my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like, 'cause tonight I'm starting life again
Get to the corner and stop, f*ck am I going
Besides sight going when I fantasize
Starting my whole life over, yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothing like
Holding your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide so in, case you're wondering why my insides showing
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and know some minds so I'm
Picking them up and stuff them in the back
F*ck it I've done enough in this rap shit, Recovery brought me nothing
But back, to right where I was and perhaps, this could've been my victory lap
If I wasn't on the verge of Relapse

I went from an irate teenager
Still raging as adult, amazing

Maybe, I should've did a better job at separating
Shady, and entertaining, from real life, but this
Dang thing, is still the hardest thing to explain
Is the crazy, or should I ever seen it back then
It was like I ain't even bother taking into consideration
You and baby and older and making me say things
I did it, yay me, and be, it just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentle, men let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit
(Or should I?) sound cranky and bitter
Complain beef and bicker about the same things
'Cause when I look at me I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get a, way and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

41,castle,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34675900/Eminem/Castle,"I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December first, nineteen ninety-five, Dear Hallie)

You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me but as long as you’re healthy
That’s all that matters for the time being but obviously
Assuming you will be, just thinking ahead
I'ma make it if it kills me, let’s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
I'm sorry for sloppy writing, the pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm 
As I'm using in this letter maybe they can fuel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world
Love, daddy
Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December first, nineteen ninety-six) 

Dear Hallie
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile 
but you ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, lil' minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em baby
I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios while I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far
I just keep steering I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My infinite CD flock, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something
Ooh, I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December twenty-fourth, two thousand and seven)

Dear Hallie
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between 'em since I rise to this fame
I said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you 
but dang, I never knew it'd be like this
If I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished fed up with it, I'm hanging it up
F*ck it! Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote 
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy
Love dad

42,walk on water,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34584874/Eminem/Walk+on+Water,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butterflies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
’til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, ""this shit is garbage""
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the f*ck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a f*ck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

It's attack of the Oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt
Every thought scarred got, now my pants off
The crosswalk, it's suspenders
And I can't feel my lips cause

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb",0
47,campaign speech,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33416845/Eminem/Campaign+Speech,"Jumped out of the second floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and hence the origin of the headless horseman
Born with the endorphin's of a pathetic orphan
Endless sores and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have been vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in to the shredded foreskin
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores in sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in
Self absorption
Skeletor, I went to hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus
Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes of course, I mess up once
You want some? Come and get some, boys
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back
His whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm desert storm
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible, hello gorgeous
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get sexual?""
She said, ""However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible""
Expired tags on the Saturn
Got Kathryn Beck in the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter, laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid...

You got it twisted
All 'cause I offered this bitch a doggie biscuit you call me misogynistic
Bitch get to massagin' this dick
Like spas in this bitch
Slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit like I've gone ballistic
With a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, ""I hate blondes,"" and became one
I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets
Trouble 'cause a double cross
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to 'cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results
As Rainman's is
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage""
What's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'm about to dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an Ace bandage
Don't-give-a-f*ck persona
To my last DNA strand, E&J in the waistband
At the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa
Pre-arrange an escape plan
Three inch blade on point like a Sensei
Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one

Great idea!

If I was president
Gettin' off is the first order of business
Once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screamin', ""F*ck safe sex,"" throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned
And make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
It's in you to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it
I walked up in major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'till I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause you're innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Tortured a, not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The board hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox
'Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The rock cuts into rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelling quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeves spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face 'till I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly I'm gone off you
Man light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, you puss
And thighs are squooshed
What kind of attires that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket",0

Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if there is a terrible crime
It's alright, 'cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name
Sing a song, 'cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there
You gon' make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

Oh, Lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

In your dream, you're drowning, I just waltzed in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwashed and persuade you
Gibraltar, you're faithful, never falter or waver
When you causing the danger I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
To the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed the First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped, put our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Whatever you have to do, you blast for me
I never doubt
That you

You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You gon' make me commit murder

Real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside,
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shot when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
F*ck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit is about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""F*ck you, Debbie!""

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating
Ain't nobody graduating
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm getting aggravated, f*ck, I'm getting agitated

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a f*ck about my descent, 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a f*ck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time

Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something

51,kings never die,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32020234/Eminem/Kings+Never+Die,"Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
Too good to be true?
Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again
Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't
Think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is
Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to
Show out on a track with me but it'd actually
Have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, f*ck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm riding shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not gonna' conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear them say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stay Jay miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say (so much) for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
(Some want a champion to fall I still wonder why I laugh at 'em
'Cause why care when I'm awesome?)
F*ck what these cynics say
(Just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm posted up)
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm coming to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked then
And I ain't stopping 'till I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
(And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving)
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

(They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay, they
Just grow wings and they fly, so
Hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over)

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
Nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leaving this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinking that they're mistaking my kindness for weakness
Kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause making the beat ain’t the same
Feeling to me as killing the beat is
So fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbing hunger
Out-rhyming everyone, God just give me one shot
I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertain even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time

I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest

Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance

I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight up to my best friend

God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it, it's like Clint Eastwood
Looking for peace though, maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked so I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause I'm a sinner

Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend) Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival
Your arch enemy surrounds you now he's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's in-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script
Cock and I shoot
Who you think's my glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah",0
53,phenomenal,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32015539/Eminem/Phenomenal,"I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Show ‘em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy
Who the f*ck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
'Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the f*ck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists to his bones
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it off like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-up valve
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about
'Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is delegation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
An accusation, I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
'Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
'Cause I am

Phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’

When I'm ripping the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""what we doin'?,"" I said to I'm, let's chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling, you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna f*ck with the.

Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it

56,the hills ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32266076/Eminem/The+Hills+%5BRemix%5D,"Said you want a little company
And I love it 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be your pill re-
Fill and I’ll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills just the effects of each
Other but we gon' film 'cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?

But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time, bullshit
What your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me
But at night, if you seek those thrills what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only f*ck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge
Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only f*ck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me

57,guilty conscience,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416854/Eminem/Guilty+Conscience,"Meet eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
(""s*** is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this"")

Alright, stop! (huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (but who are you?)
I'm your motherf***in conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than george burns

F*** that! do that s***! shoot that b****!
Can you afford to blow this s***? are you that rich?
Why you give a f*** if she dies? are you that b****?
Do you really think she gives a f*** if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!	(you're right!)
Not over this s*** (stop!) drop the biscuit (i will!)
Don't even listen to slim yo, he's bad for you
(you know what dre? I don't like your attitude..)

(""It's alright see'mon, just come in here for a minute"")
(""I don't know!"")
(""Look baby.."")
(""Damn!"")
(""Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?"")
(""Well ok.."")

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (""give me a kiss!"")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play... (""s***!"")

Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
And smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little b****'s earlobe..
(Yo! this girl's only fifteen years old

You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair? (uh huh!)
F*** this b**** right here on the spot bare
'Til she pa**es out and she forgot how she got there

(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _kids_?)
No, but I seen the porno with sundoobiest!
(s***, you want to get hauled off to jail?)
Man f*** that, hit that s*** raw dawg and bail..

Meet grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.

(""What the f***?!?!"")
(""Grady!!"")

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

F*** that s***, you just caught this b**** cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
F*** slittin her throat, cut this b****'s head off!!!

Wait! what if there's an explanation for this s***?
(what? she tripped? fell? landed on his dick?!)
Alright shady, maybe he's right grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay! thought about it, still want to stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes??!

What'chu say? (what's wrong?	 didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherf***er!

Uhhh-aahh! temper temper!
Mr. dre? mr. n.w.a.?
Mr. ak comin' straight outta compton why'all better make way?
How in the f*** you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

""Oh my God!"" 

These are the results of a thousand electric volts, 
A neck with bolts ""Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse!"" 
A kid who refused to respect adults, 
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose. 
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery, 
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me. 
And I might snap, one day just like that 
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack. 
My first day in junior high, this kid said, 
""Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"" 
I looked at my watch it was one twenty, 
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?"" 
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first. 
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"" 
I screamed, ""Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst! 
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"" 
""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"" 
""Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?"" 
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"" 
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over. 
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."" 
""But don't you want to give me after school detention?"" 
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your a** and I'm a let him""

Brain damage 

Way before my baby daughter Hailey, 
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey. 
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes, 
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers. 
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin', 
And had me in the position to beat me into submission. 
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose, 
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat. 
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef"" 
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe. 
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!"" 
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me. 
I made them think they beat me to death, 
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left. 
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth. 
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws. 
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools. 
""This is for every time you took my orange juice, 
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk. 
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt. 
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good. 
I c***ed the broomstick back and swung hard as I could, 
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood. 
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot. 
Made it home later that same day. 
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray. 
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read. 
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed. 
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?? 
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!) 
She beat me over the head with the remote control, 
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull. 
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look b****, what have you done?"" 
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you c***!"" 
I said, ""F*** it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head, 
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck. 

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born

59,if i had,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416944/Eminem/If+I+Had,"What is life? 
Life is like a big obstacle 
In front of your optical to slow you down 

And every time you think you gotten past it 
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground 
What are friends? 
Friends are people that you think are your friends 
But they really your enemies, with secret identities 
And disguises, to hide they true colors 
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers 
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin' 

What is money? 
Money is what makes a man act funny 
Money is the root of all evil 
Money'll make them same friends come back around 
Swearing that they was always down 

What is life? 
I'm tired of life 
I'm tired of backstabbing a** snakes with friendly grins 
I'm tired of committing so many sins 
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins 
Tired of never having any ends 
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things 
I'm tired of this DJ playing your s*** when he spins 
Tired of not having a deal 
Tired of having to deal with the bulls*** without grabbing the steel 
Tired of drowning in my sorrow 
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo 
I'm tired of motherf***ers spraying s*** and dartin' off 
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour 
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off 
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough 
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk 
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk 
I'm tired of using plastic silverware 
Tired of working in Building Square 
Tired of not being a millionaire 
But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 

If I had a magic wand, 
I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, 
While I'm on the john 
If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, 
Because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor 
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store 
I'm tired of not having a phone 
Tired of not having a home 
To have one in if I did have it on 
Tired of not driving a B-M 
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him 
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M 
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum 
Tired of not being on tour 
Tired of f***ing the same blond whore 
After work in the back of a Contour 
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones 
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns 

Tired of being stared at 
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat 
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz 
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs 
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me 
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me 
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs 
Tired of J-L-be	 saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives"" 

But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john 

If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 
You know what I'm saying? 
I'm tired of all of this bulls*** 
Telling me to be positive 
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see s*** positive? 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
I rap about s*** around me, s*** I see 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Right now I'm tired of everything 
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city 
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'? 
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Just fed up 
That's my word",0

Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'm a always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk

Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)

And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you want to help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
Dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson

And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad

She was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, want to ba-ba?

Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)

That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you want to help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock

Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order

No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

61,role model,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416941/Eminem/Role+Model,"Okay
I am going to attempt to drown myself 
You can try this at home 
You can be just like me 

Mic check 1, 2 
We recording?
I'm cancerous 
So when I dis you, you wouldn't want to answer this 
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus 
I strangled you to death and I choked you again 
And break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin 
You beef wit' me, I'm even the score equally 
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally 
I get too blunted off the funny home grown 
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono 
So if I said I never did drugs 
That would mean i lie and get fucked more than the President does 
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert 
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet 
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge 
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads 
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les '
Follow me and do exactly what the song says 
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people 
And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal 
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal 
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill 
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill 
'Cause I stand out like a green hat wit a orange bill 
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist 
How the f*ck can I be white, I don't even exist 
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave 
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave 
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave 
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave 

Now follow me and do exactly what you see 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D. 
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me 

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole 
When we heard a knock at the door, must of been Ron Gold 
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold 
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco 
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk 
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt 
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer 
That'll spray an Aerosol can up in the ozone layer 
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue 
Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch 
Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on 
And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn 
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits 
A premature birth that was four minutes late 
Mother are you there, I love you 
I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel 
Will someone explain to my brain 
That I just severed a main vein 
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain 
I take a breather and sigh 
Either I'm high, or I'm nuts 
'Cause if you ain't even in this room neither am I 
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass 
Then It's probably obvious that I got it on with her 
'Cause when I drop it off with this solo shit it's over with 
I bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it 

I came to the club drunk with a fake I-D 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I've been with ten women who got H-I-V 
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I tied a rope around my penis then I jumped from a tree 
You probably want to grow up and be just like me",0
62,my fault,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416954/Eminem/My+Fault,"[Eminem does the voices of all characters in the song]
[G] eminem as Susan (the girl)
[D] eminem as Dave
[J] eminem as John
[R] eminem as Ron

[Chorus: x2]
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

[Eminem]
I went to john's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date

Susan... an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
Who love booze and alternative music (what-up?)
Told me she was starvin', I said it wasn't a problem (nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage

[G]
I'm allergic to fungus
Come on sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door??	pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? wasn't it yours? nuh uh
[G] 
If you got it with double mushrooms on it then I don't want it
Shut up Susan I'll pick em off it
Oh hell, I might as well try it, I'll be alright
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!

[Chorus: x2]

""Yo sue!""

[G] 
Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..

[G] 
I need to go puke!
I wasn't tryin' to turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin', I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase you and spank you with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said,

[G] 
Help me I think I'm havin' a seizure!
I said, ""you're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!""
""would you put it down you're startin' to scare me""
She said,

[G] 
I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here sue, (hi) you're talkin' to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate

[Chorus: x2]

Susan (wait!) where you goin'? you better be careful

[G] 
Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin' to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin' dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
""John, where's Dave at before I bash you?""

[J] 
He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin' a crap dude!
""Dave! pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin' to plants
Choppin' her hair off, and there's only two days left
Of spring break, how long do these things take to wear off?""

[D] 
Well it depends on how many pieces she ate
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives""

[D] 
She's gonna die dude
""I know and it's my fault!""

[D] 
My god!

[Chorus: x2] 

My god, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! please wake up!! what are you doing?!
You're not dead!! you're not dead!
I know you're not dead!",0

Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
Alright, turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list
You want to get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a f*ck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin', ""I suck""
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud, ""All of y'all, get the hell out now""
F*ck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D, they was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'til I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

This song is dedicated to all the happy people 
All the happy people 
That have real nice lives 

That have now idea what's it like to be broke as f*** 
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope 
Without a circus net 
I'm popping Percocet
I'm a nervous wreck 
I deserve respect 
But I'm working sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tec at somebody to reverse this debt 
Minimum wage got my adrenaline cave 
Pull the venom in rage 
Especially when I'm engaged 
And my daughters down to her last dipper 
That's got my a** hyper 
I prayed to god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer 
Watching ballers well they flossing and pathfinders 
These overnight stars become autograph signers 
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us 
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters 
Well Player haters turn a b**** like they have vagina's 
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us 
Money will brainwash and leave your a** minus 
Snakes slither in the gra** spine less

That's rock bottom 
When this life makes you mad enough to kill 
That's rock bottom 
When you want something bad enough to steal 
That's rock bottom 
When you feel you have had it up to hear 
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
 
My life is full of empty promises 
And broken dreams 
I'm hopin' things look up 
But there ain't no job openings 
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, un-furnished 
I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay 
Tired of being hired and fired on the same day 
But f*** it, you know the rules to the game, play 
Cause when we die we know were all going the same way 
It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
All you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in the six 
They threw me in the mix 
With all these gloomy loony lunatics 
Walk around impressed 
And smoke a pound of sess a day 
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was yesterday 
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play 
Life half my life and throw the rest away 

[Chorus: x2]

There's people that love me and people that hate me 
But its the evil that made me this backstabber M-C called Slim Shady 
I want the money, the woman, the fortune, the fame 
Means I ain't burning in hell scorching in flames 
Means I m stealing your checkbook and forging your name 
This lifetime lives for eternal torture and pain 
Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom 
I got problems and now everybody on my block's got 'em 
I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em 
Holding two glocks, I hope your door got new locks on 'em 
My daughters feet ain't got no shoe's or sock's on 'em 
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rock's on 'em 
While you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them 
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em? 
Cause I never went gold off one song 
I'm running up on someones lawn with guns drawn

Round and round 
(As the World turns we all experience things in life)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 
(Trials and tribulations that we all must go through)
I don't know why this world keep turning 
(When someone wants to test us when someone tries our patience)
Round and round 
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 

I hang with a bunch of hippies 
And wacky tobacco planters 
Who swallow lit roaches 
And light up like jack-o-lanterns 
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts 
'cause we're dope as f*** and only get a two in the source 
They never should've booted me out of reform school 
Deformed fool, takin' a s***, in the warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn 
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!) 
It all started when my mother took my bike away 
'cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave 
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers 
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors 
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman 
F*** the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin' 
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead, 
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed 
May be true, till I told this b**** in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who me?) 
Yeah b**** you so big 
You walked into Big Panties and stepped on Jenny Craig 
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig 
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig 
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (rar!) 
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming 
Grabbed that b**** by her hair 
Drug her across the ground 
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down 
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop 
While I drop this b**** face down and watch her belly flop 

I don't know why this world keep turning (as the world turns)
Round and round 
(These are the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 
(These are the things we must go through day by day)

We drive around in million dollar sports cars 
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards 
Outsiders, and we suing the courts 
'Cause we dope as f*** and only get a two in The Source 
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat 
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blonds be at 
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage 
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park b**** 
I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya"" 
I'd like to treat ya to a bagel and a slice of pizza 
But I'm broke as f*** and I don't get paid till the first of next month 
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt 
But I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers 
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist 
So gimme all your money 
And don't try nothin' funny 
'Cause you know your stinkin' a** is too fat to try to outrun me 
I went to grab my gun 
That's when her a** put it on me 
Wit' an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry 
I fell through the glass doors 
Started causin' a scene 
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine 
Jumped up with a broken back 
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day 
And doped up off coke and smack 
All I wanted to do was rape the b**** and snatch her purse 
Now I want to kill her 
But so I gotta catch her first 
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut 
Saw the house she ran up in 
And shot her f***in' porch up 
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut 
Looked around the room 
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut 
I know you're in there b****! I got my gun c***ed! 
You might as well come out now 
She said ""Come in, its unlocked!"" 
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne 
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn 
She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"" 
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it 
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her 
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her 
I started to beg ""No, please let go"" 
But she swallowed my f***in' leg whole like an egg roll 
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled 
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple 
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick 
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick! 
Whipped that s*** out, and ain't no doubt about it 
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage 
I shouted ""Now b****, lets see who gets the best!"" 
Stuffed that s*** in crooked and f***ed that fat slut to death (Ah! ah!) 

Come here b****! 
Come here! 
Take this motherf***in' dick! 
B****, come here! 

I don't know why this world keep turning 
(And as we go along)
Round and round 
(Throughout the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 
(We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday)
I don't know why this world keep turning 
(That we must go through)
Round and round 
(These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 

I don't know why this world keep turning 
(Every day every single day the world keeps turning)

68,im shady,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416947/Eminem/Im+Shady,"Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, ""F*ck the world!""
(I'm Slim Shady) so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot (uh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'm a come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

I like happy things,
I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things
That make me happy and gleeful (he he he)
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hm)
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)

How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
So bring the money by tonight, cause your wife
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a f*ck you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Aw that shit is wack!)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
(What? That's my shit!)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So f*ck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)
And if I told you I had aid y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack (uh-uh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uh)
She's still alive and bitchin' (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being aids infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
(I'm Slim Shady) I'm Shady!

(Ha ha ha ha)
I told you I was Shady!
(Ha ha)

Y'all didn't wanna believe me!
I'm Shady!

69,bad meets evil,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416946/Eminem/Bad+Meets+Evil,"I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts 
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon 
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over 
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em 
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen 
Got murdered in cold blood 
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home 
They say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern 
And on a quiet night 
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet 
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat 
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head 
Trapped him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed 
Til' the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
Told him each one of his boys is dead 
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said 

Who hard? yo I done heard worse 
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
To see which one will swerve first 
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds 
That of a globe, on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil 
Intelligence level is 'hell-ier' than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto 
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist 
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse 
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse 
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations 
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
We hit the trees til' we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal 
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either 
(s***, me neither) 
We ain't eager to be legal 
So please leave me wi't the keys to your Jeep Eagle 
I breathe ether in three amounts 
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle 
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain (He's insane) 
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off 
'Cause I can't find a decent vain 

The disaster wit' dreads 
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough 
To kill my soul after I'm dead 
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 
'Cause I serve any stranger wit' money 
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains 
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches 
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral 
Service lobby, strangle your body to confirm you 
Whippin' human a**, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws 
Wit' my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and gla** 
I'm blazin' M-C's, at the same time amazin' M-C's 
Somehow M-C's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me 
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche 
And bust till volcanoes erupt 

Hello? (Billy) 
Ah-yo what's up (we're comin' to get you) 
Stop they know it's us! 

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah) 
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh) 
Well I'm out now (s***)
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up 
And I ain't goin' leave you a window to jump out of 
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms 
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms 
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave 
I'm a put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Segal 
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel 

(We'll be waitin') 
See you in hell 
Wall Street, 
Royce Da 5'9, Slim Shady 
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye) 
Bad meets evil, what? (till next time)

And so that's the story when bad meets evil 
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens 
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did 
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon 
But their spirits still live on til' this day 
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?",0

Brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady

Slim shady does not give a f*ck, what you think?
(Tell 'em to suck it)

If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know, upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)

Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you
(Yeah)
Anything else?
Yeah, sue me",0
71,kill you,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416939/Eminem/Kill+You,"When I was just a little baby boy
My Mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my Daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin', I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?

Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
F*ck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again

You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal' ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead

('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
F*ck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
F*ck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor

From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said, ""Shut up"", when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said

Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, f*ck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk 'bout you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together, too

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim (shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!)
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit just clownin', dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

F*ck, what a story
(I never knew I)
Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I)
And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk, when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the f*ck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn 'em around

Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
F*ck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me, when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin, ""Go"", with their seventeen year old uncle
I'm like, ""Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked, if they liked violence?""

And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow, your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me, that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And 'F*ck' was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird

So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch, I never knew I'd

Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
F*ck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me?
And run up in the school shootin'
When they're pissed at a teach

Her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop

It's ridiculous! I can't believe it! ! 
Hold on, em
What up? 
Have a seat? Dre, I'll call you back
What now? 
I don't even know where to start
Okay
I got the album from upstairs
And
And this is by far, the most,

Incredible thing, I've ever heard",0
75,the way i am,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416864/Eminem/The+Way+I+Am,"Man, whatever
Dre just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone
F*ck it, just shut up and listen, ayo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this—on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a f*ck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am",0

May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so f*ck him and f*ck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a f*ck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I’m high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

For this one, they scream ""X, you retarded?!""
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term “universal,” without no rehearsal
I leak words that’s controversial
Like I’m not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I’ll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin’ through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like “No! No! No!!!”
Life’s a bitch, met her, f*ck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it’s all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I’m the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can’t-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin’ he ain’t a killer, but I’m killin’ myself
Smoke death, f*ck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I’ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who’d do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we’ll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I’m gettin’ wires, niggas wantin’ me dead
Wantin’ my head, you think it could be somethin’ I said?

Remember me? I just don’t give a f*ck!
Remember me? Yeah, f*ck you too!
Remember me? I’m low down and I’m shifty!
Remember me? I’m Shady!

When I go out, I’ma go out shootin’
I don’t mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I’m tryin’ to clean up my fuckin’ image
So I promised the fuckin’ critics
I wouldn’t say “fuckin’” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on!
My baby’s mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin’ these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I’m stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she’s on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16’s and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint’s speech to fix these streets?!
F*ck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match!
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat! Show ’em where it’s at!

78,marshall mathers,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416930/Eminem/Marshall+Mathers,"You know, I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em something
The f*ck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the f*ck outta here!

You see, I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a f*ck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (Take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him ‘cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

The New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it

Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (ha-ha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear
In faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns ‘cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the f*ck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (You talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (Best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go f*ck Puffy!
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the f*ck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Um, here, ""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aww, f*ck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

‘Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a f*ck before

Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to get the party start
We used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
And when it kicks in, you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and probably barf
And my prediction is you're probably fall
Either in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything spinning 
You're beginnin' to think like a woman
Are swimming in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it,and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a forty-two-car pileup
Earth calling pilot to copilot
Looking for life on this planet,sir, no sigh of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might dieif go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in outer spacei've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Some geek keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't want to, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

With ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aww, naww, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, (What?) dick six inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (a .44)

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again
I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?!
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the f*ck up! (You're drunk!
You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a f*ck?!
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me, Kim! You really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a -year-old little 
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me!
What the f*ck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
F*ck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the f*ck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the f*ck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the f*ck could you do this to me?!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on

I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!
Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!
Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!) F*ck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm crackin' up, get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!) So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only makin' this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah, somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the f*ck up and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the f*ck outta everything I come across in the halls

I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators

My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me

I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a f*ck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron

I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)

I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats

Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets,ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's

Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums

I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it

I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys

If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order

I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run

Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a f*ck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

A lot of people think that what I say on records
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do it in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that

Well, shit if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why? 'cause I'm a

Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's, ""Yes""
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin'
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get a hold of 'em

Hey, it's me, Versace
Whops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it? Checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an Amen
Amen
Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons

Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
Who?
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. ""Don't Give A F*ck"" still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the f*ck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink malt liquor to f*ck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna f*ck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went when the president got oral sex
In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white
Blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
The maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look
Uh huh
Just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money
And get the f*ck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you

What?
Don't kill nobody this time
Aw right, goddamn, f*ck

Hi
How you doin'?
How can I help you?
Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag, bitch
And I won't kill you
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Just don't kill me, I have two kids at home
I said, I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
Don't kill me
Hurry the f*ck up
Thank you

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a f*ck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal

86,white america,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32416921/Eminem/White+America,"America! We love you! 
How many people are proud 
to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? 
The stripes and the stars for the rights 
that men have died for to protect 
The women and men who have broke their necks 
for the freedom of speech 
The United States government has sworn to uphold. 
(Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) 
or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, 
So many motherf***in' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs, 
It's like a f***in' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed 
in no particular direction, 
Just sprays and sprays 
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays, 
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought, 
standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide, 
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear 
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? 
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office, 
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, 
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled s*** all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

[Chorus]
White America! 
I could be one of your kids,
white America!
little Eric looks just like this,
White America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get, 
white America!
I Could be one of your kids, 
white America!
little Eric looks just like this, 
white America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ya'self
If they were brown
Shady lose 
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so f*** school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the f***in' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a f*** I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like ""F*** it""
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his a**
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this s*** wow
I'm like ""My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?""

[Chorus]

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthaf***in' turbulance
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like 
""I dont like this, no!""
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a b**** and say fagot
S***,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthaf***in' spokesman now for

[Chorus]

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
F*** you Ms. Cheney
F*** you tipper Gore
F*** you with the freeness of speech this 
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
F*** you!

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show""

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight

I'll be brief and let me just keep s*** simple, 
Can-a-b**** don't want no beef with Slim? No!
Not even on my radar, so won't you please jump off my dick, 
Lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance, 
Aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw

C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back. 
Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration, 
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like, 
This white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt, 
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, 
Won't go nowhere, do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there, go to Beirut and do a show there
Yah you laugh till your muthaf***in' a** gets drafted, 
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
Till you f*** around, get an anthrax napkin, 
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping, 
F***in' a**a**ins hijackin' Amtracks crashin'
All this terror America demands action, 
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's a** askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy. 
You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans. 
I'm twenty-eight, they're gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy? When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait, 
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me, 
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully, 
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic, hypnotic product I got it the antibiotic, 
Ain't nobody hotter and so on
And yada yada, god I talk a lotta hem de lay la la la, 
Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make, 
Keep makin' new s***, 
Produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me? 
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege, somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry, like a f***in' younger me, f*** the fee, 
I can get you jumped for free
Yah buddy, laugh it's funny, 
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pa** the K-why, 
Let's get ready for some intense, serious a** f***ing!

C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!
C'mon now, let's all get on down, 
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, cus there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout, 
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me
Cana-b****, won't square dance with me
Fan-a-b****, won't square dance with me
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen, wants to square dance with you

(Brr, brr, brr)
Machine
(Brr)
It's not a game, nigga (brr, brr)
It's not a fuckin' game, nigga (brr, brr, brr)
Look, look

Ayo, I use the Arm & Hammer just to fluff my brick
Say what I wanna say, and I don't give a f*ck, I'm rich (ah)
Tuck my fifth, don't hesitate to bust my shit
I tell you niggas like Kyrie, ""Suck my dick"" (haha)
I don't trust a soul, I don't even trust my bitch (uh-uh)
Before I fall in love, I'd rather cut my wrist (ah)
I sweat Ace of Spades, nigga, that's how much I sip
Body a rap nigga quick before the Dutch got twist
(Ayo, let's roll somethin')
Yeah, the shotty ring, this shit is not a thing (uh-huh)
Chopper make your body lean, my niggas body things (brr)
Uh, I'm with the jackboys, I'm with the robbin' team (uh-huh)
On my mama, I never rocked a pair of Robin jeans (hahaha)
Everything I jot is mean, how you gon' stop Machine?
My name, it probably ring like Las Vegas slot machines
The MAC by my pelvis in my Helmut Lang (uh-huh)
The shells'll bang, make everything outta your helmet hang (boom boom)
Uh, the mayo jar was Hellmann's when I swirled the 'caine
Then I wrapped the yayo up in cellophane (woo)
My shooter got Dame Lillard from the elbow aim
I thought of that while I was courtside at the Melo game (ah)
Bricks are off-white, I imported some (uh-huh)
Whippin' all night until the mornin' come (all night, nigga)
Still pitchin' long nights until my fortune come
That's big checks on the side like the Off-White Jordan 1s, uh

Ayo, they think this shit a game, nigga (this shit a game, nigga)
Ayo, they think this shit a game (this shit a game) (oh word?)
Ayo, they think this shit a game
Until I pull up, let it ring, nigga (let it ring, nigga)
Until I pull up, let it ring (let it ring)
Until I pull up, let it ring
Ayo, they think this shit a game, nigga (this shit a game, nigga)
Ayo, they think this shit a game (this shit a game, huh?)
Ayo, they think this shit a game
Until I pull up, let it bang, nigga (let it bang, nigga)
Until I pull up, let it bang (let it bang) (boom, boom, boom)
Until I pull up, let it (boom)

I used to be a man of the people
Hit the clubs and mingle (what up?)
Used to dream one day I'd be fuckin' pink like a flamingo (pink)
That was back when I smoked Canibus
Man, but it was tough, 'cause I was a fan of his
So it sucked to hand him his ass, but
Yeah, lookin' back on my feuds
How me and Ja Rule almost got cool
'Cause we shot pool back in '01
Was it '02? I don't know, but
Something told me fuckin' not to
Then we got stuck in high school, I shoved an Oscar up his wazoo
Yeah, but I think of the rappers I slayed and buried like every night
And every career I might've killed, sometimes I say a prayer and I
Wonder is there a heaven for a G? And if so, is the sanctuary nice?
Studios for rap like Coolio, shootin' craps at gangster's paradise
Huh, here a mic, there a mic
Everywhere a mic, share and share alike
But just don't compare alike
Instead of comparin' me, pick a fair fight
Compare me to lightnin', that similarity's strikin'
Compare me to Jaws
Compare me to Manson, Marilyn or Charles
Compare me to Nas, Biggie, or Pac
Do not compare me to that Iggy bitch
Or all this fuckin' Milli Vanilli hip-hop
This is where all that silly shit stops
Compare me to the pistol that triggered this thought
The semi, the Glock, 9 millis get cocked, I'm sending a shot
Don't come around with them floss raps tryna stunt
Compare me to Meek, big wheelies get popped
One by one, compare 'em to scabs, I'm picking them off
They're going home to f*ck Nicki Minaj, aw
Compare me to Diggity-Das, yah
I'm hickity-hitting it raw, ha
In the trailer park (haha)
Told her I'd play the part like Kanan Stark's
Ate her twat like a Tater Tot, oh shit
Get the strap like a trainin' bra
Lunchtime like at eight-o'clock
But Shady's not for the faint of heart
Goin' at these pricks like Lorena Bobbitt
Y'all want drama, we can make a scary movie like Marlon Wayans
Y'all lookin' at the charred remains of Charlamagne tha God
Slim whip, Westside, and Conway are not playin'
I cock back, aim, and I spray you like (boom)",0

Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And drop it on yo fuckin' head, haha
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""F*ck 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*ck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a f*ck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce  and olives
I'll fuckin'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker

Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare
F*ck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye

You want the sleep me to wake, you want Slim Shady EP
That's on the CD cover, sockin' my mirror (Sockin' my mirror)
I promise not to cry crocodile tears (Crocodile tears)
If you end up shocked at my lyrics (Shocked at my lyrics)
Marshall is dead in the water, but not that I care
Dre said, ""Rock the boat"" and the Doc is my pier
So, it's unanimous, you're at attention, the planet's listenin'
And their banana splits again, which has its advantages
But when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickenson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture, then ripped it in half
And whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many rounds or if I get knocked down
In a bout and fell to the ground
I got a fighter's mentality, I'll get back up and fight with it
In fact, I'ma attackin' the mic with it
I'll make it sound (Sound) like a vampire's bitin' it
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick (Sidekick)
To be down for the count (Haha), yeah
Yo, album's (What?), out (Yeah), now (Uh)

I just wanna play, big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know what's better for you
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight no oh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb
About to blow oh oh

Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren oh oh
We don't look for trouble,
Just enough to seeing double

But we'll forget so
F*ck what they say
Let the rum flow until it rains oh oh

Only bottles of pop
My bottles are popped so when I pop up in the spot
I'm probably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc
I'm not Puffy but I'ma run this city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin' idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights
Little indignity, hot diggity
This Biggie is gettin' me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you
I'll knock a dick in the dirt, bickerin' worse
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel
Hangin' from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building
'Cause we're tearin' it down, security get out
The frickin' way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it's loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going eeh 'cause

Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

Yeah, 03, I went from plain filthy to filthy rich
Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
'Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
Sipping on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spaghett-even?
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the buginning
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', f*ck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plu~gged in the
Motherfucking wall with three thousand volts of electrucity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers in each
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
F*ck letting up, you’re gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again
I'm thinking about just saying
""Mother f*ck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!""
'Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
'Cause I'm running in circles with

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away

No place to go

It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide

I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like forty million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it three A.M. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs
Of every fucking thing livin'

To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so f*ck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a f*ck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And f*ck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that f*ck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary 
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out (write it out)
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh (haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (bitch!)

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
F*ck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew",0

Damn girl
Do I drive you crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things, I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things, that I never felt
You gotta be the real thing 'cause you remind me of myself",0
97,like home,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35192610/Eminem/Like+Home,"Yo, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
He's tryin' to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (yeah)

Here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home",0
98,arose,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35192603/Eminem/Arose,"If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning, so definite, wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm trying to rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, f*ck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin', now I know",0

Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)

But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a base-head!"" Uh-uh!
""So why's your face red? Man you wasted!""
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off

I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)

I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide

I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the f*ck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

He'll fucking flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
F*ck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
F*ck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya

102,desperation,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35705335/Eminem/Desperation,"Girl you gimme writers block
I’m at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can’t be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it’s both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain’t

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don’t wanna share you with no one else
What the f*ck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That’s a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany’s
You better have an epiphany",0
103,groundhog day,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35705334/Eminem/Groundhog+Day,"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
""I remember it clearly, even today""
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, F*ck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey",0
104,beautiful pain,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35705333/Eminem/Beautiful+Pain,"I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light",0
105,'till i collapse ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/9980308/Eminem/%27Till+I+Collapse+%5BInstrumental%5D,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a f*ck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me",0

[Skam]
Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear (F*ck that!)
Bustin' lyrics in the air
Keepin' some up in the chamber

[Eminem]
Yo Skam, what the f*ck you doin'?

[Skam]
Man, I'm releasin anger!

I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day

See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear

Aiyyo Shady what the f*ck you doin'?

[Shady]
I'm releasin anger!

[Skam]
Man I'm tired of bein' tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin', and endin' up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the f*ck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin', girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like im throwin' gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposi''n the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but f*ck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the f*ck you doin?)

Chorus

[Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ""O"" that I snifed off caine
You know you're spaced the f*ck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drip

I used to rock a toboggan
Headphones around my neck, tryna be like Shady
Now the phone that's in my pocket seem to keep vibratin'
I got all these Ronnie Bennetts tryna be my baby
Tryna fiancé me
I take the steering wheel and drive them girls beyond crazy (crazy)
I'm on a song with my idol
I'm a cold-blooded version of the song title
I put these diamonds in the ring like they was Shawn Michaels
I can't put the Louis V inside the wash cycle
I take this shit to the cleaners
'Bout to cop me a Bimmer, I got a special demeanor
She was mine when I seen her, I'm gettin' meaner and meaner
Called the front desk and asked for a steamer
I'm a bitch bagger, not a Twitch streamer
I'm eatin' pizza in Little Italy, damn, I used to hit Caesars

Give hell with these writtens, this shit only propel my ascension
I held my position in any situation that's needed

I see the impact of all my creations increasin'
My step in time with these Pantheons, it all was divine
I'm in this moment of my life where shit is fallin' in line
And lookin' back, I swear to God, you'd think it all was designed
A true movie script, I can't really ever f*ck no groupie bitch
All she got is diamonds on her mind on some Uzi shit
A whole generation of geniuses I'm influencin'
I only hang with real niggas who I'm congruent with
I manifest nothing less than the best outcome
Just watch my moves with this next album, nigga

Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'

Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided
to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the

Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
Shit, the day that I dont straight shoot

Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon

The penitentiary, ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you do, not tempt me

You mistaken me for somebody that you should be testing
Your should be stressin' I'm gonna f***in teach you a lesson
M-A-C one-oh-one's in session and lace the track that I'm blessin'
Smith and western's, the weapon, in case you just guessing, these straight busters kept-in, kept-in
Watch the twenty-two spin , my hoe's a perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherf***ers they thought I wouldn't win, pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best don't you get it, forget it, when I spit it, its crazy
You love it, admit it, you like it, I live it, its Shady
Aftermath in your a** b****, if its not a classic
When it's dumped, trash it, so I got it mastered
Stop and get your a** kicked, bastered, your misses get drastic
Glock made out of plastic, c***-it and get blasted
Run n**** and stash it

I'm a drink till I get to that b**** in the morn
Introduce me to the booth they gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my s***

Picture a perfect picture, picture me in the paper
Picture me starting s***, picture me busting my gat
Picture police man Dan gotta picture of that
Picture me being broke, picture me smokin' a sack
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me going back
To my momma basement to live, s***, picture that
Where I'm from its a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, use a target jack
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that p****, crew are back
Fifty Cent, too much spent, man I'm bent, I'm outta here

Yeah, for real, yeah, yeah
Switched it up, don' changed the shit on that damn
Yeah, everybody don' ran through it
Mumble rappin'
Ain't no more substance in shit
Right, right
(They don't treat it how it needs to be treated)
I kinda want that old thing back

Yeah, I was young, I was hungry
I was chasing the bag at twenty-one
I was lucky to find an uneaten fuckin' (what?)
Honeybun I forgot about
Now I got money falling out, fifties, hundreds, and twenties (right)
And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing
But we got something in common, both of us are alarmin' (what?)
Foul, disgusting, and awful (yeah), so repugnant and ugly (yup)
I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah
And you could say I'm a little bit immature
But this type of literature got me a little richer, haha
But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
You're letting him fiddle with your clitoris
Remember you were my fuckin'

You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things will never be the same
Ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script
You done let a bunch of lames fall through
And complain that I can't burn it
You ain't have to do it like that
Told you I'd be right back
Look at what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music I had to bounce on my favorite bitch

Yeah, always hated my smile
Mama told me it's goofy
I'd get picked on at school
Come home and she'd school me
She never sugarcoated it to me
She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly
I wouldn't always get bullied (true)
I think of my struggles and get emotional
Could be 'cause how behind the 8-ball
And far in the hole that they put me
Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (yeah)
I'm just trollin' you pussies
But I'm like stroller 'cause you'll see just how I roll if you push me (haha)

But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times I drew from her
But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her
'Cause the thought of losing her
Makes me just wanna just let loose on her
When I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her

Tell her, it's a butt-dial girl, yeah, booty-call (haha)
That's how it used to be
'Cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (Fifty)
F*ck, I miss them days

You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things will never be the same
Ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script
You done let a bunch of lames fall through
And complain that I can't burn it
You ain't have to do it like that
Told you I'd be right back
Look at what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music I had to bounce on my favorite bitch

You fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?
I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
I swear to God, you run to that door
I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head
Now I'ma ask you this one time
And the answer better be, ""Yes""

Would you marry me again?
Now that everything is changed (yeah)
It'll never be the same (ah)
As the era whence we came (who?)
From Nas to Pac, Rock (yeah), Eric B, and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo MTV Raps (yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode
The feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape
You hold and peel it back, yeah
Tear it off then play it (what?)
Swear to God, 4 o'clock
We crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks
When Nani was con-artisted (yeah)
And Proof had his hair in locks (doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearing clocks
Back with Ed Lover (yes)
And there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (pair of docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't don't wanna (yeah), stop 'til I get you back
'Cause I got put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
The other part wants to tell you to just get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped you're mind
You must be buying your time looking for someone to come along
That'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully it was never really you and me
Exclusively it is too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through
Bet they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can
Hear me? I used to be your favorite, bitch",0

You ran inside, told your boyfriend like, ""I'll be back""

This a song about
My, my stepdad
Let's see if this ever happened to you
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures that I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I cried
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I just wish I could jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection and put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion
Then mom and him let bygones, just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this why I

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry, which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes ""Whoops"" and just laughs
I yelled for mom (mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""F*ck you punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter wein
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)",0
120,don't front,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30159817/Eminem/Don%27t+Front,"Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the the Doc replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
'Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the ""dope,"" so when names come up
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere, where it fires and I unload my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause they were new
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
'Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo why you frontin', you know I got you open, kid

Rest in piece to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like I'm in the zone
I'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
From beef, beep-beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as f*ck, but can't even say bon appetit
'Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, homes, your mind's blown
'Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed, up in the Ebony Showcase
With Denaun screaming ""Who the f*ck passed you the mic?""
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
'Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the f*ck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
'Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo why you frontin', you know I got you open, kid

Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight
'Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke was so long ago, I lost my concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's this good with the fucking mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
You know I got you open, Word Life",0

You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn

Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' off of coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
(Deal with life)
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talkin' reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged
Ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (yeah)
Was a have-not (yeah) 'cause my pockets (uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get colder, began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the Doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""F*ck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' f*ck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare

Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn

Lady, I've been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
Hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (yeah)
Been checkin' you out ever since the second you stepped in through Nani's dressing room
Girl, you're stunning, I'd bet that you'd zap me if I was next to you
Sparks'll fly, I expect them too
I'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're Carmen Electrocute (cutie)
And those ain't just sound effects, I knew something was special as soon as we swapped info
I knew that

She loves me, she loves me not
For who I am, but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
She loves me (one more time)
I said 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me

Sorry I missed your call again, I be in the studio usually
But tomorrow afternoon for me, it'd work beautifully
If your schedule's open, you say, ""That's cool with me
But you stood me up twice, Slim, you're 0-for-2 with me""
'Cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
Well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
Yeah, I'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the D
And soon as we hung up, I'm like, ""Woo""

'Cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
She loves me (ayy yo, lemme do this bridge right quick)

She pulls me close and whispers to me, oh
Lies in my ear, but that's all I wanna hear
It's okay long as we both know this is all it is, whoa
She can have my love for as long as we both are here

Back in my spot now
The music is loud, so I turn the boombox down
We cut off our cell phones
You're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like Balboa
'Cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (whoo)
I put the moves on you like a U-Haul
Bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall to the floor
But canoodlin', I'm not in the mood for
Gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna spoon, doll
But before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
We can f*ck in the closet or in my elevator (uh)
And maybe when it stops and the door opens, we fall out and we just get off on this floor (haha)
You say you're falling for me but not 'cause I'm famous
Then explain to me who that tattoo that's your leg's of?
Girl, your game is an A-plus but you think I don't notice who the screensaver on your damn phone is?
It ain't 'cause who I am, bullshit
I like you, just don't take me for no stupid ass
No disrespect, 'cause even though you're like my truest fan
Know it's clear you only love me 'cause I'm Superman, Lois
But f*ck it

'Cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me (one more time)
I said 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not

And I still ain't been to bed (bed, bed)
And while you got your eyes closed
The devil wakes up in my (head, head)
He told me that you hate me
And you blame me
And you said that you wish that you were dead
So I write a little note out
Suicidal love roulette

You make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
I'd rather a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
Just like a fool
Just like a fool

I walk up to the edge, yeah
And say a prayer before I let go (let go, let go)
I'll probably see you through the window
While I'm falling past the fifth floor (fifth floor, fifth floor)
Then you get there just in time
To save me and apologize
And maybe we can go back to bed
But you run past me instead
And hit the ground before I can

I had to watch you
Jump off the roof
Boy, I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool

Maybe Buddha's got it right
We reincarnate every time
And I'll find you in another life
Maybe Buddha's got it right

I just wanna spend the night (yeah)
But I don't wanna spend the night
Actin' out, ""Love the way you lie""
But this shit just went awry
Hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry
I'm at the end of my wits
Let's end this, ma (it's over)
Then begin again tomorrow
Fresh start, let you spoil me
Pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king 
Just to (royalty), f*ck me over royally
Boy, are we water mixed with oil
See another shouting match
'Bout to have it out
But no matter how, mad I get
I'm so mad about you
Forgot what I was even mad about ('bout)
I know we've had our challenges still (still)
I keep trying to salvage it you (you)
Wanna sabotage it, I'm down to the hill
But you think I'm fucking around on you, chill (chill)
It never changes, I doubt if it will (will)
Cheat on me then say how does it feel? (feel)
I feel like blowing my fucking head off
After I write you out of my will (will)
Bitch how could you? (huh?)
Almost had a child with you
Would've settled down with you
Now put you in the ground and bury myself with you
I don't get you, it's as if you're drowning
I stick my hand out, but you fool me
You're just trying to pull me down with you (down with you)
Thought it was you my world revolve around ('round)
I should aim a revolver round at you (at you)
180 proof, as I'm making my way to the roof (roof)
You're a traitor I say that we're through (through)
You hop in the elevator then you
Say the coffin they better make it for two (two)
'Cause if you jump I'm jumpin' with you (you)
And neither one of us have nothin' to lose
But each other we're just a couple of fools

'Cause you make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool

You make me wanna

You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah, I do, haha

I look at me now I'm thinkin, ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They hollerin', ""Shady""
Yellin' it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get a chance to get a crowd
I'll flip it around and have a crowd give me the chance
I've done it all, man
But in actuality I haven't, yet

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch but I was grateful to trade that shit for the trailer with the hitch
Thought it would made me a ravin' lunatic
But I made it through to my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
Now I'm just paradin', you would still get Shady 'til I'm eighty two
I spit this crazy, even Dre he knows I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (my only question is)

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flop, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on their grind, makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you water down
You gotta take shots with 100 proof

Check that
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have the savage within
Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an MC
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti
Would be like remedial readin' to me (yeah)
'Til my last breath leave my lungs, I'ma beat my drums (yeah)
For the streets I'm from (yeah)
The east side slums (yeah)
Gotta remind 'em (yeah)
I take a foe out (yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (what), you see my thumb (what?)
You see my fist, f*ck a peach pipe bum (what?)
For the smoke but it's not the weed I want (what?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I come (woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm off kickin' feet in the recliner
And I think I'm up
'Bout to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Since kindergarten, mental sharpness
Which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'
Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (meal's gonna come from)
Now I just wonder (now I just wonder) where my next mil's gonna come from
I cannot have no success, unless when I finally make it
I get to remind all the haters, who shitted on me when I'm on my way up
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
I will swear on a stack of Bibles
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols
I don't care, it's Music To Be Murdered By
So Bon Iver can swallow a fucking Ja Rule bobblehead
Then die slow like Alzheimer's (haha)
Low sniper, I hold the micro-phone like a loaded rifle
My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull is fire
All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires
And y'all are a flow biters, so I don't gotta explain why they call me your ghostwriter

I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said, I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad (yeah), every thought that I had (Illa)

Haven't used all the tricks I had, so like my balls, it's in my bag
I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad
But gift of gab and pen to pad
Turn temper tantrums into anthems
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks
Spit your damnedest, you're still gonna hit the canvas
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
Then the amygdala hippocampus
Is gonna trigger the ingoramus
To think of the most ridiculous shit then spit
Then pin it against these pitiful rappers
Insidious, these idiots witty as shit, against me, shitty as MC Hammers
Get your whole squad, send the task force in
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for
Then put your helmet on, strap your chin
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
Or to go against, f*ck would you wanna do that for?
No offense, but are you retard, slow or dense?
A fuckin' penny has more sense
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal
But every thought is so ill and so methodical
Thought I swallowed a pill, I'm startin' to feel like I'm an automobile
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snotty articles
And that explains why the f*ck you clowns are all in my grill
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame
Choice I made, swore someday
The world'll pay, less to lose, more to gain
Daughter's raised, yesterday, glory days, adored and praised
Ignore the hate, address the fake
Toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came
Destroyed the game, before you came, enjoy your stay
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim
That you're gonna point and aim
If you joined a gang, your shit isn't goin' to bang
You're just boring, lame and more the same
You have an enormous chain, but a storm-less brain
The most you could form is rain
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
So, bitch, quit lyin', your denyin' like Mr Porter's name
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter
Fire motor, rounds I told to every iota or I load up
I owe to my motor, mouth
This is my note to self
Sometimes you're gonna bomb
So you might just have to blow yourself up with no one's help
I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
Premo, take us out

Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside",0

(D.A. got that dope)

They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (damn)
Then it goes from Martian to human (yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat

Still stackin' my chips, hoes, higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin', this shit is like child's play, children
I will not annihilate, kill them, I'll f*ck around and pile eight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then, I'll await my trial date 'til then
Ain't nothin' you say can ever Trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw and rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or naw? (Naw)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough

They come at me with machine guns (brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat (yeah, yeah)

And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (what), that's social distancing (yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the f*ck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end? Like Monroe, Norma Jean
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope), for some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (whoa)
I got a contact like eyewear
Whoa, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea
F*ck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the f*ck off
I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfuckin' ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (damn)
Then it goes from Martian to human (yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (brr)

128,these demons,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893624/Eminem/These+Demons,"Yeah, you know what? (LoudPack)
Haters are funny, man (haha)
It's like, you're gonna hate it no matter what it is
Yet you still click on it, huh, yeah (Zombie on the track)

I want you to change, but don't change (yeah)
I want you to grow up, but don't age
I want the rage, but don't get too angry
I want the new, but old Shady
I want you to say what they won't say (yeah)
Just don't go too far, but go cray
I want you to almost lose it, man
It keep movin' the goal post, don't they?
So let's cut to the chase, like OJ
In his Bronco goin' up the roadway (skrr)
And get off my dick
If I said my balls were yarn, you bitches would crochet
All I ever wanted's a rope chain
From the day I saw Cool J on Soul Train
Now I got that, Kangol 2k
Was one yellow and white gold plated
Just to let 'em know I made it

I told my dawgs we gon' get right in they ear, yeah
Wouldn't call, now dip, gone in the Lear, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down, yeah, yeah

This pandemic got us in a recession
We need to reopen America (what)
Black people dyin', they want equal rights
White people wanna get hair cuts (haha)
Some people protest, some people riot (what)
But we ain't never escapin' this virus (nah)
To the cops that are racially biased (what)
We no longer enable these liars
You get 'em on tape, they stick to a story, like Spider-Man crawin' up side of a wall and
Some are just as unabiding as lawmen (yeah)
Like Garrett Rolfe and like Derek Chauvin (yeah)
No cap, still riding with Colin
Though some people don't like me at all and (yeah)
Some are like bees to flowers (why)
'Cause some people find me appalling (haha)
Ooh, I say a line, people are outraged (oh no)
The press slams me again (yeah), the people aren't having it nowadays
Give an album that I put out in like 2000 you griped about praise
But I wake up everyday even more caked up than the makeup on your clown face
And I lay my foundation

I told my dawgs we gon' get right in they ear, yeah
Wouldn't call, now dip, gone in the Lear, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down, yeah, yeah

I got a question (what)
What rhymes with Pariah? (I don't know)
Mm, uh, LEGO? (Oh shit)
You just bit into the lit end of the wick
Shit, I meant, shit end of the stick
I'm addicted to friction and mischief
It's like your bitch's midriff, shit gets my dick stiff as a stickshift
Dick as in Cheney, drip as in saline
They bring my name up just to get ratings
It's like trying to choose between Bizzy, Layzie, and Wish against Krayzie
'Cause I got a bone to pick and Slim Shady (Shady)
With Thug (Thug) and Harmony (yeah)
Who attempt to diss Hailie (Hailie)
Bitch, I will go in like it's raining
And I get cancelled like once a day (yeah)
Why would I go? It's more fun to stay (ah)
You get me to leave, there's no fuckin' way
I got a better chance of fuckin' Young M.A. (ooh)
Ooh, sounds like I'm zoning
So me sayin' I'm out, nice to know me
It's like askin' me where my shin is
It's down right below knee (haha)
Uh, oh, well we can play hide the salami (yeah)
If your gal would like to blow me (yeah)
My wave is like a tsunami (yeah)
These flows you're still tryna rap your head around like you're a swami (ha)
Just call me the mic kamikaze with Mike Zombie and I'ma just keep bombing (woo)
'Cause the game is mine, like an IED (yeah)
If they ever do cancel me like Live PD
I said I'm takin' some of you with me if I'm leaving (brr)
It's time to murder you now, sike, leave me
I might knee deep to the fuckin' ice, Z, Z
Rappin' circle around these ho's
Just like gurgles and every word from my mouth so fire
I should be burnt to the ground
There's a fuckin' circus in town, yeah bitch, this verse finna clown ICP
R. Kelly sex tape, I see pee (whoa)
My shit is intense, like tipis
You gettin' wiped, like TP
You don't like me? You can bite my little white wee-wee
And I repeat, you can bite my little white wee-wee long as I like it-it
And ever since my pre-teens, striped Lee jeans and grandma Nan's little black and white TV (yeah)
Now I'm so bougie that I stick out my pinkie every time I drink tea
Used to want a wife, sweet tea (sweet tea)
Used to rock wife beaters, now I let your wife beat me (yeah)
So you can eat shit, but I might be the shit

129,alfred's theme,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893631/Eminem/Alfred%27s+Theme,"Before I check the mic (check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (yeah) give zero fucks, then I (yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then I (yeah)
Check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising every time I drop
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do, it's see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like snores, but odds like that with these thoughts I have's
Like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands

Shit, hold on, man
Motherfucker
Happy birthday to
F*ck (shh, quiet)

I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

What the f*ck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

So until the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (yeah), D.R.E and me (yup)
From the MMLP to MTBMB (bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (haha)
So call me Santa Clause (Santa Clause)
'Cause at the present (yeah), I out-rap 'em all, I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (uh)
Through a plastic straw (yeah) with a fractured jaw (damn)
My dick is coat check (ha), she wanna jack it off (yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car, get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the f*ck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (damn)
And this the final chapter, 'cause I'm either frying after
Or they gon' give me the needle (what) like a vinyl scratcher
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite like a tree mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (bark, bark, bar king)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (why) ball hard (ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bar's were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (nah)
So you'd be a fitted (yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee on your head, like a Phillies hat (haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you'd probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna f*ck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all'll get cut the f*ck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole

Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
F*ck it",0
130,tone deaf,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893630/Eminem/Tone+Deaf,"Yeah, I'm sorry (huh?)
What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (out, haha)
(I need Auto-Tune)
Yeah

It's my alter-ego's fault, these evil thoughts can be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat those off to Rico Suave, look it up
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel
A backpack full of Paxil
A black satchel, a nap sack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels
Girl, let's go back, back to my castle (yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (oh)
You, wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (what?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and X do (What the f*ck?)
'Cause who the f*ck am I laying next to? (Eh)
But ever since D-Nice ""To tha Rescue""
Feel a fresh crew (uh), been a lab rat (yeah)
From a test tube (uh), I'm goin' in like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watching your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race, stuck in saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is, I'm drivin' 'em all crazy

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (yeah, yeah)

I see the rap game then attack the verses (uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (what?)
Pockets on stuffed like a taxidermist (woo)
Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan
Colored van pulled up with a hand full of Xans
And a substantial amount of ganja, just to ask what my
Plans for the night are (yeah)
I said sneakin' to the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five star
Yeah, or leap into the deep end of the pool, I can show you where the dives are
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live, but I'm tryna get some head first, like a nose dive (haha)
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
Pushed her out the side, kicked, then I flipped
The lil' white bitch off like a light switch (bitch)
It's okay not to like my shit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch
But ask me, will I stick to my guns like adhesive tape?
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats the cheesecake and the decent steak?
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Haha)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that shit for the damn library (shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah) Well, I am piss piss off'ed-eson (oh)
Paul's askin' for Christmas off again
I said, ""No,"" then I spit this song for him, it goes

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Bitch, I can make an orange rhyme with banana, oranana
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma
But I'm more like I'm 4'5"" with the grammar
Bitch, 'bout to show you why your five favorite rappers, can't touch this
But before I get the hammer, I should warn you I'm Thor-like in this manner
But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or
I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me
I'd need to be a motherfuckin' pizzeria, but you ain't gettin' no cheese from me
I went from Lil' Ceasers, BLT-ses, grilled cheeses
Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch
Like a realtor, it's realty, bitch (real talk)
Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit
We put out fire, Dre stamps it
With my cohorts, hit up Bogart
Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', ""Oh, God""
Here comes Marshall, with no holds barred
Bitch, I'm a hurricane, you're a blow hard
Like your old broad, she full of semen, like the coast guard
And life's been pretty good to me so far, for the most part
Had a couple of run-in's with popo, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors like crowbars
Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so bitch, don't start
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart
I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw
'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw
And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' Colt cocked
My enemies I'm a chimney give me the smoke, opps
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
What the f*ck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter-ego's fault
But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob'
I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (I'm tone deaf)",0

Bitch, you lost me (yeah)
Fair weather, wishy-washy
She thinks Machine washed me (what?)
Swear to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd crossed me (yeah)
I love conflict, got a obnoxious (what?) subconscious (yeah)
I'm afraid to unlock it (nah)
Keep those monsters in the closet
I'm what an idiotic ('otic) savant is (savant is)
But I've been throwin' down gauntlets since that underground ruckus (yeah)
Where I planted my roots (what, yeah)
That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (nah)
So imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak
As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats
Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus
But, me, long as I re-promise to be honest
And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri
It wasn't meant to cause you grief
Regardless, it was wrong of me, but

I be on my own (yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the G.O.A.T."", I come down like, ""Ooh""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you

Yeah, they woke a giant up
So, when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the
F*ck is my head in the clouds (nah)
G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head in the clouds (haha)
Mile-high club (why), I give a flying f*ck (no)
Punchline, I'm just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas (bitch)
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima
Syrup, I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a
Dozen, said I couldn't do it
Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (ugh)
Like a stirrup (stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (yeah)
Now, I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (haha)

I be on my own (yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus

Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around

I've seen them come and go
I've seen the hugest (hugest) debuts ('buts)
I've had a great view to see the (see the) game through (through)
And, Drake, they're gonna turn on you (you) one day too (too)
And the more you win, the sooner (sooner) they do
They'll be calling you a trash bin
Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
They ain't never comin' back in
They did it to Chance
Next they'll be mentionin' Future in the past tense (yeah)
Or sayin' ""Adios"" to Migos
I ain't dissin', I'm just tryna keep this shit a C-note (yeah)
Same people been tryna do this shit to me, so
I call them peephole
Because they're so easy to see through 'em (see through 'em)
But a fighter's all I knew how to be
I got the shit beat out of me (yeah)
Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (pop)
Popped it back in and hopped up like, ""F*ck it (f*ck it)
Best two out of three"", yeah
Man, I gotta be doin' (what) somethin' right
I got eleven years of sobriety (yeah)
So, the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me
How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
I'm diplomatic 'cause I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, dog, you was like a (yeah) damn God to me
Man, not really (haha)
I had ""dog"" backwards

Ayy, ayy, ayy
(Hit-Boy)
Ayy, this that Clipse sample, ayy (G.Ry got me)
F*ck that talking, let the clip slam 'em
Yellow bands around them hundreds, you know how much that is
Too much to give me cash, they had to wire me the back end
Niggas in here looking tough, you know that I got Mag in
Ask me am I only rapping, you know I got that bag in
Band man like Lonnie, want my head, come find me
Lil' bro in that bitch chilling he ain't tryna come home cocky
He comin' home to a dollar and a mansion and a choppa
And a desert on a dirt bike, VLONE shirt and the Pradas
Big nigga fresher than you, f*ck you and your stylist
Paid 90 for my grill and lost it, that's why I ain't smiling
You got Sean, you got Hit, you got Grizz, Kash Dolla
Paint you red, throw you in the water
They gonna think you a lobster, nigga

Uh
I just dropped a kit, you dropped out of school
These hoes wanna be famous 'til they make the news
All my bitches winning, how it feel to lose?
Nigga tryna get the box like he finna move
Bitch, I'm at my pinnacle I used to shop at Pinnacle, your nigga still drink Pinnacle
Bitch, your taste is pitiful
I talk cash shit, you ain't cash shit, call up Baby Choppa, Cash Kidd, and spend my cash, kid
You stay back like ad libs, I buy, I don't ask shit, I pop shit and pop tags, bitch
This New Era be cappin', uh
Me, Sean, T off that Pusha T, ain't no pushing me, bro might put you on a tee
Dot my eyes and cross my T's, bro might put you six feet or bro gon' put you on your feet
But bro can't put you on to me, A plus pussy worth a B, nigga, uh
You niggas ain't with no B, f*ck outta here

I keep dying in my dreams, but life's great when I stay woke
Bet you love dreaming, that's the only time you ain't broke
Try me, .40 make you back up off me like Dej Loaf and Big Sean
Get triggered down, Jhene Aiko
Gotta keep Glock in the fanny, nigga, you not finna ham me, huh
Put a body on a ratchet, I feel like Dr. Miami
Niggas tryna ride my wave like they stopping a taxi
On a six, in a Lamb', but I'm not that bitch Mary (Helluva made this beat, baby)

Four-one
They counted me out, I came back with a vengeance
And back to back Benzes, back to back winning
Rap failed, oh well, gimme back my scale and a burn out cell, I'll grow clientele
Four-one P, I don't sell dreams, I wholesale P's, want half's nigga, don't call me
Don't insult me, wrist frosty, 'bout eighty what this shit cost me
Don't worry, I'll make it back before you sip coffee
I roll with hustlers n' bosses, bosses n' hustlers, had to find my hustle I was lost in the gutter
Got out that jam now its foreigns with the seats peanut butter
Bitch, it's BYLUG for life, never crossing my brothers

(Let's go)
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

I f*ck with 6 Mile, not too much the 7, they freed the 4s
That's your bitch, huh? Well, get her together, she fucking bro
You know them road trips still bring a dub in, sub in
Even if the party was seven, the strip club ten
I'm all in this bitch, tryna tether, I'm throwing dubs still
I put her in the Bentley, mansion rent free
Told her keep the G-Wagen plain, don't even tint these
Can't be fucking with a lame, dawg, you got her head big
300 a line for the Wock', I'm sipping red still
I know how the feds feel, I make it hard to catch me
'Cause selling corn still, code word for reggies
I ain't sign a deal yetm f*ck itm I don't need 'em
Everybody with me eatingm free my niggas 'til I see 'em
He ain't dead, we ain't even jet back, ante up, bitch
Free them boys

(Shit hard)
(Where you at, Bo?)

We gon' make it off the ave, get a half, then I shake it
Somethin' like a bad habit, we ain't have it, we gon' take it
Came up off a fifty slab, now my bag big as yappers
Workers begging me for time off, asking me for raises
Took me six hours to count it, bubble wrap it up and tape it
All my bitches want allowance, plug asking me for favors
I been out of town so long, had to get reacquainted with the neighbors
On the block all these cash we been raking

Way before the rap when I was writing verses
We was beating up the Ike like I was Tina Turner
We was loading up the Glock and filling up the hearses
Now I'm preaching like it's Sunday, tryna teach the sermon
Trying to teach 'em how to get it fill up they mama purses
So they ain't standing in front of judge listing to the verdicts
'Cause we was standing on the block thugging with the serpents
Get caught with Curtis Blow on me and they gon' close the curtains

Million dollar cars you can't merge in, BasedGod how I got my curse lift
She gon' play her part so well you thought that she rehearsed it
Don life worship, holly temple, synagogue, tabernacle, churches

Yeah (Hit-Boy)
Look, I can't even chill I get active, overdoing everything my best and worst habit
Shit be impossible 'til it happens, I never thought I'd see Kobe go before Magic
That taught me first, no seconds to waste, only waist I like is her legs wrapped around my face
F*ck you think she doing over here, watching Netflix?
Beard game, might just let it grow down to my necklace
I don't hope for wins, I expect it, uh, adrenaline in me like it got injected
My girl said I got communication issues, no I don't
I just don't like sharing all my problems more than the results
I bring the plan back to my team, tell 'em go wild
God body, my physique, and my profile
I did every single goal that I wrote down, checked it off it's old now
And that shit give me chills, f*ck I gotta take yours
I'm the originator, make it then I make more, written in stone, you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same building on the same floor
Oh boy, black out, dough boy, cash out, payroll
Contract maxed out, cash kid, cash cow, tapped in, I can't tap out
Bitch, keep thinking I'm sleeping in, it's Tony on the monitor, I see your ass creeping in
Little bitch, if it weren't for me you wouldn't exist, you get the gist?
F*ck a cease and desist, they shooting up seats in exits
Throwing plays to my bros, I'm leading the league in assists
Hop scotch, black top, I ain't been skipping a step since
Real estate, Zillow every day, bitch, I might just change my profession
Dodged so many rainy days, it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested

(Let's go then)

Hmm, f*ck the bullshit, I ain't here to make no friends, can't get bool with me
Since an adolescence, I was ignorant, up in school tripping
Pistol at my desk, I was sitting up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket, play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick, both balls licked, and do it to me (what else?)
Ain't go to college, I ain't want no pussy nigga rooming with me
Still coulda went to college, Sada ain't no fool, nigga
Every clip we got extended, yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on you niggas, scrap them boys for half a biscuit
You know I like the burner but I'll beat your ass, this shit personal, huh
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh

(Yeah, go Royce)

Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artist, don dada, to G
Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather and P
D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada and T
Standing on the corner three days, phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or a gold Ellesses 
These are ordered from the older East Bay's
She either rolling with the owners or the lessee
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothing
I thought I told you mother fuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide got arenas buzzin'
We survived getting fronted by Ilina cousin
Before you could sell like Cole and Adele 
Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight as been fixed since the opening bell
And you know who posting your bail? Who promoting your L?
Who be hoping you fail? Nigga, Oprah and ",0
133,leaving heaven,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37920578/Eminem/Leaving+Heaven,"Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (yeah)

Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""F*ck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the f*ck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (what?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
A God but a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the f*ck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

I'm leaving Heaven (yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (you know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (f*ck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (you know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)

So you better, you better run (yeah)
You better, you better run (so I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (cocksucker)
You better, you better run (see you in Hell)",0

'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm startin' to sound like ALF a bit
Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills
Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb
But the word, ""Fuckin'"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Hoe thinks her snatch is magical but that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact it'll be nothing to throw that little bitch with a capital B 
Out the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds
A pad and a pen'll be great but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisible Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger
And crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra (extra) terrestrial (yeah)
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial (skrrt)

Yeah
I could keep beefing, f*ck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in hell but I should get puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said gave you an L, in hell
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growin' up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy!""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head say, ""It's still a dream""
Then he said, ""Kill MCs""
Trippie Redd, with pills on lean
Sippin' meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

My name's Marsh and I'm out this world (this world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra (extra) terrestrial (yeah)
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial (skrrt)

So all of y'all can just suck a penis (suck a penis)
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)

'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
You wanna butt heads? Shut up Beavis, ha ha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (bitch)
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dug out (yeah)
I should just live in a nut house
Right now, I live in an igloo (yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the f*ck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (yeah)
So why, w-w-w-why else, would I call myself an alien?
How could I hit a dry spell (yeah), I'm named after the wetlands

I'm Marsh and I'm out this world (this world)

Hate is a sin dog, be real

You on Twitter in your feels
Throwin' subs, arguin' with chicks
I pray for these niggas, same hands that I hustle with
Passin' the offering plates, I'm the preacher in foreign whips
Sermons and politics, miracles come with each and every flip
That dinero from zero, so heaven-sent
Immaculate, blessings from Mary, I reminisce
On days we was broke, all we had was some common sense
Last night, I had a nightmare, I was at the stove
I woke up in Paris, cookin' up for Hov
That's why I thank the Lord for givin' me this life
And even when I'm gone, the music keepin' us alive
Yeah, it's called forever-ever
Ever-ever, ever-ever, family ties

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
I'm so grateful, all I need is love
To the Lord above

G6 globals, who'da thunk it, from the projects
Eight balls, some poppy, went and dunked it in the Pyrex
Mischievous thoughts 'fore seein' the sauce
Told Montana in the G, chicky poo in the Porsche
The Frank Sinatra of the Spanish mobsters
We the Jimmy's Cafe, ain't no need for operas
Had the fiends scream, ""Hallelujah,"" f*ck the prosecutor
Gave my nigga fifty years, and he was not the shooter
When they see us, solitar' confinement
Dig deep in your mind, no pressure, no diamonds
So we live a life, drop a hundred at the ferry, yeah
My chick's from San Fran, but stay out my bae area
You salute the cross, or you rebuke the cross
Either way you meet the Lord when you get moved across
Death knockin' at your door got you squeezin' handles
And you ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel

And I've been good, oh
All I need is love
To the Lord above

I'm sittin' here, reminiscin', think I just got a light bulb
Somethin' I'd like to mention, this is just on a side note
Word to the Terror Squad, Joe, this is all puns aside though
I know me and Mariah didn't end on a high note
But that other dude's whipped, that pussy got him neutered
Tried to tell him this chick's a nut job before he got his jewels clipped
Almost got my caboose kicked, fool, quit, you not gon' do shit
I let her chop my balls off, too 'fore I lost to you, Nick
I should quit watchin' news clips, yeah
My balls are too big, I should be talkin' pool
'Cause I got scratch, so my pockets full when I'm takin' shots at you
F*ck it, lemme chalk the cue stick
I'm over the top, like Cool Whip
And I promise you the day I fall off or lose it
I will stop and cut off the music
Opportunist, wanna kill shit every chance that I got to do this
Stackin' my guap, savage, I'm not
To fool with, like a handgun, you could say I'm like a gat when it's cocked
I keep it a (buck, buck), your ass'll get shot
If rap was an actual Glock, you'd act like you're strapped when you're not
Only cap that you pop is the top on the can of your pop
You the man 'til I pop your top
You ain't Jack in a Box
And I ain't talkin' a hamburger spot
Cracker with the barrel, armed to the teeth, Anderson .Paak (yeah)
Rest in peace to Afeni and her son Pac
You sent me that plaque with his rhyme sheet, I haven't forgot (nah)
Blow 30 million in a month, call it Brewster's Millions
Just hope I don't lose the feelin', from soldier to civilian
Got everything I need but I don't even see myself in the future chillin'
Only thing I don't have in the booth's a ceiling, just call me the roofless villain
They tellin' me sky's the limit, so I got my head in the clouds
Unicorn in human form, saw a gift horse, looked him dead in the mouth
(And Lord) And Lord, good lookin' out, for sendin' me Edna and Charles
Whenever mom kicked me out of the house
They were the bomb, then you sent me L-L
All the times that I hated myself, since eleven or twelve
Only way that I knew how to better myself is when I'm bet against by everyone else
So Joe hit the head on the nail
You ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel
I was gun shy, but now like a snail
The slug's comin' out of its shell

Oh, there's no hate in this world
That can make me give up
That can keep me stuck

I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (she came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
That's the broke lingo (huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (hello)
Disrespect your life and I'm in gang mode (grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (huh)
I'm in cake mode (huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (brrr)
Collect pesos (huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (hey)
When the pain leaves (huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the Backwood is where the flame goes (there)
To the sky is where my brain goes (wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (what?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

Game over, Thanos on you H-Os
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (yeah)
Get the plunger (plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three SWATs
Or police officers at least to pull me off of it 
And I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 
'Cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards 
Who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic
It'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim
Better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone
Who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me 
Is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins
I'm God and the Lord forgives
Even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone 
When you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube
And The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music
The more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling, ""bombs away,"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (f*ck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy
They call me Kanye crazy
""APESHIT,"" Beyonce, Jay-Z
And I'm back with Andre, baby
And the doctor's operating
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K.Dot to Shady

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect
I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet
Now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips
All the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you
I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the f*ck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that as a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (f*ck you), I'm unaccommodating",0

I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets""

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"")

I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm

Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (woo)
Tin brain, probably fucked in the membrane
Slim Shade, minds in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame
(Screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet

Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost

Yeah
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the killshot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt
Should've never made a response to the disdain for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill
(I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"") Can't do it, nah

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"")

138,farewell,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648657/Eminem/Farewell,"(Ricky Racks)
For what it's worth
You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd f*ck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with, but this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?

Probably 'cause I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, fight, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find
To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line
But nothing comes to mind besides the number 90
'Cause since '06, you flipped my fucking life upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows
Make it rain upwards, we're on that ninth cloud
Two insane lovebirds, I should fly south
'Cause man, am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, ""F*ck it,"" cry our eyes out

Then I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax, then dump your ass in the bathtub
Yeah, now that's love
May sound pathetic, but f*ck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane 'bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending would be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we're not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a fifty cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner see, addiction is a disease

I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

139,never love again,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648667/Eminem/Never+Love+Again,"I could be with anybody, I choose you
Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd used you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""
Next I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up
Then I got you totally open as soon as I take your top off
You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
My friends say you're bad for me, hogwash

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back

Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in Saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the f*ck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back

So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality, somehow it seems like
When I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep, you're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my Valium, I'm an addict you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiends how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G-O-D
I thought you loved me, but you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
F*ck all you

Fuckin' bitch
We're done",0

So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
My joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the f*ck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or the Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (yeah)
I'm L. L. Cool J, bigger and deffer, that's how come (uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (what?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by",0

Where vets rejects elect the cell

To blaze a separate trail, 'cause, uh, they was inept as well
Inherited they debt, we set to fail, please reset the scale
Niggas clappin' on Saturday, but we ain't see SNL
No comedy skits, just llamas and sticks and drama and shit
Baby mamas and jits, piranhas in pits, and brought up the bitch
Honestly, it's only right I get a zombie as a fix
This bass to your face from a speaker make you a tweaker
I laced it with ether
It'll take you a week to bounce back off one hit of this
Niggas is clitoris, way too frivolous
This is far more dire, the bars is hardcore
Like parkour with barbed wire
GRIP is the dark horse that spark wars and start fires
Hole in one on a par four or higher, and your supplier
Tour guide for hire, poor guy, he's tired
Cut him some slack, he's strapped raps to his back

Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Pulling from the script but the sides are empty

Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world

Sometimes I wonder really what did my closed head injury do?
I'm literally missin' a screw, but it seems like
My memory's too vivid to forget the shit I been through (Yeah)
So as my residuals grew, I remembered those kids who were cruel
Same individuals at Elizabeth Little
And essentially used them as the fuel
Who would've knew what the pencil could do, though, so mentally screwed
They said ""Marshall, you're either gonna wind up dead
Or in a penitentiary, 'cause eventually you'll end up clenchin' a tool
And come back vengefully to shoot them bullies
Who clowned you in elementary school""
Yeah, my head, something's wrong with it (Yeah)
But that makes me me, I'm different (Yup)
That lyrical phenom misfit
Since I was a bleach blonde who hear the beat on
This which makes me only think of demonic shit (what?)
I was knockin' on death's door (yeah), I fucking ding-dong ditched it
(Ha, yeah), yeah, and I don't do that sing-song bitch shit
And I don't use autotune, all I do is spit, and this shit just bothers you
Call it quits bitch, impossible
My pen just popped your thought-balloon, you dipshits know how I'ma do it
Send a motherfucking beat to the trauma-unit, yeah, Shady Records
Look at all these squad killers we brought with us
Juggernauts and Godzillas, you don't rock with us you're off of your rockers
Bitch, backs to the wall
Is it always, is why I'm not talkin' about wallets and knots
When I say that the wall it is not against
It's more like the cross
Look at how far this is past you
Regardless you want me to reach a fuckin' bar that does not exist
No pun intended, but GRIP, hold on to this moment
'Cause soon as you reach the top, they're gon' want you to fall from it
So you better grab your seatbelt
Like I did mine, and fasten yours
Like a motherfucking plane-crash passenger
'Cause one day you'll be crashing back to earth
And if you don't ever stop to smell the roses
I do know one thing, that's for sure
You don't get your flowers 'til you pushin' up daisies
And that's about all your ashes earn

Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn

Was a ghetto boy, now I ball out like Bushwick Bill
Finna take you out like an outro
Bruce Wayne and Alfred, look out, ho
Blueface meets Albert DeSalvo
Balboa with a scalpel
Scoundrel hound with a mouth full of Alpo, now go

Little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go

Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe

And anybody can get it, COVID
You fuckin' with that?
I done wrote shit that was so sharp 
I could slit my own fucking throat with it
So rich, I got more chips than my shoulders
And I'm about as approachable as a roach is (roach is)
Yeah, so better steer clear from him
Here comes a nuclear bomb for your eardrums
Lyricism at its most fearsome and fierce
We are on another tier like a tear duct's upper echelon (yeah)
Your career subbing me (what?), It was sheer luck (like what?)
Like a fuckin' leprechaun with its beard cut
(Still a) punisher, weapon drawn with a beer gut
You're slower than a Decepticon with its gear stuck
(And I what?) I serial kill, and you're Kellogg's
I love checks and I hate tricks
And you're a fake bitch (bitch)
I could spot you like you 'bout to weight lift (yeah)
Bitch, I'm badder than cake mix

You cunts must be out of your labias
And God is my alias, so if I don't have faith in me
Then it basically makes me an atheist (woo)

In a chokehold and a sleeper (yeah)

But, like a Doberman, I'm a whole different breeder (what?)
Animal mutt mixed with a overachiever (yeah)
Oh, you're the king of rap? You're about to be overthrown
Like a pass over the head of an open receiver
At least you can end up comin' to blows like a wiener
But, I ain't finish puttin' these hoes through the ringer (nah)
Like clothes in between the two roll is a weight
No, what I mean is flow's interwoven, I treat 'em like thread (why?)
That's how I wound up sewin' machine up
So, fucks if you don't give up me the time to ride or die (yeah)
'Cause you're either both or you're neither (yeah)
Throw a middle finger up (yeah) if you're rollin' (yeah)

They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor

They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor

You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Swagger on ten since a day old

Go off your head like I'm Ayo
Out of this world, talkin' NATO
It's 'cause of jail, don't be an A-hole
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so (lay low!)
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues

I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi and the Taliban plotting an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent
Up on a little like Osama with a bomb under the bin
And down the middle of the Pentagon
And hit a kindergartener with a rental (stop!)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
""Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?"" (huh?)
""Why you always gotta smack a whore?"" (huh?)

Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, ""'Walk On Water' sucks""
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it
So you formed your verdict
While you sat with your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (wait, Em!)
But nowadays, every flow, every cadence sound the same (skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta space
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara
To ""How can I be down?"", all of us tryna pile in the car (yeah!)
We shot for the stars (yeah!)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (yeah!)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the f*ck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face
And practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
""Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyoncé this and Kehlani that"" (yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em

To the body bag, I'll be back
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like

She haunts me like no other (feel like)
Nobody told me (I don't know) love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (but it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (it's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains

We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
Last time I broke her collar bone, she's intolerable (yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phenomenal, though
We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
People don't like us together but like we care (not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals for her with both of my feet bare (yeah)
But soon as I asked to hit (asked to hit), it's like she grabs a switch (grabs a switch)
Turns me over her knee, 'cause my ass is whipped
Yeah, and I got her back, but I'm spineless (yeah)
So when she stabs me in mine (yeah), it's like I just can't feel the knife (what)
As she pokes, jabs it and slices
One minute she'll build me up (up)
The next, she'll push me 'round
Probably why she calls me ""Dumbbell""
She lifts me up (yeah), then puts me down (huh)
But I am under her thumbnail
I must be under her spell
It's like lookin' right into a gun barrel
But none of these hoes can f*ck with my girl
She got that

Black magic, night walker
She haunts me like no other
Nobody told me love is pain, oh
Black magic, dark water
Surrounds me like no other
She's got my heart in chains

We wake up, break up, make up
Like Maybelline, now she's all made up like make believe
Probably why she's so fake to me
But what the f*ck's it gonna take for me to make her see?
Strip her naked and take her keys
I been plannin' this day for weeks but I can't tell if I'm wake or sleep
Or if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain
I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
But hurt by her motherfuckin' hairs
All I imagine, dragon
She lunges, attacks, and scratches
But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
Like Kaep for the National Anthem
As I stab, I'm laughin'
So much for witchcraft and magic
Abracadabra that bitch
No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
I give her one last hug, goodbye
Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
But in hindsight, think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
As I pop another five Vic's
That's what this high's like
Look down, there's blood on my Nikes
Shovel at my side, blood on my mic
Now wake up to music to be murdered by

I'm discombobulated
Let's take 'em back (accents)
In time (everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this

Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, f*ck, I'm discombobulated

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So baby, please, take off your clothes
(No) yes (no) yes (no) no (yes) oh (oh), yeah

Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (haha)
F*ck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw
And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup
Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute
'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (yeah)
Wizard of 'ahs' and 'ohhs'
Same Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice
Who also used to sound like Nas on ""Live at the Barbeque""
Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you

Like, au jus, but beef, if like
""I was you,"" but, like, ah, f*ck you (man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So baby, please, take off your clothes
(No) yes (no) yes (no) no (yes) oh (oh), yeah

I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking shi-dit
Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the f*ck?

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side

Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends
I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't
Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the f*ck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
(Squee!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost
'Till we get to Las Vegas

Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the f*ck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said saint, por favor
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas

Uh, I'm with the jackboys, I'm with the robbin' team (uh-huh)
On my mama, I never rocked a pair of Robin jeans (hahahaha)
Everything I jot is mean, how you gon' stop Machine?
My name, it probably ring like Las Vegas slot machines (talk to 'em)
The MAC by my pelvis in my Helmut Lang (uh-huh)
The shells'll bang, make everything outta your helmet hang
Uh, the mayo jar was Hellmann's when I swirled the 'caine
Then I wrapped the yayo up in cellophane (woo)
My shooter got Dame Lillard from the elbow aim
I thought of that while I was courtside at the 'Melo game (ah)
Bricks are off-white, I imported some (uh-huh)
Whippin' all night until the mornin' come (all night, nigga)
Still pitchin' long nights until my fortune come
That's big checks on the side like the Off-White Jordan 1s, ugh!

Ayo, they think this shit a game, nigga (this shit a game, nigga)
Ayo, they think this shit a game (this shit a game, oh word?)
Ayo, they think this shit a game
Until I pull up, let it ring, nigga (let it ring, nigga)
Until I pull up, let it ring (let it ring)
Until I pull up, let it ring

Until I pull up, let it bang (let it bang)
Until I pull up, let it

Ayo, SE Gang, who fuckin' with that? (Ah)
Growin' up, everybody mama loves you on crack
We got bodies (got bodies, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
With the masters of Pinoy
My nigga did five, he came home with a kilo' (yeah)

I was listenin' to Stan with Coke flippin' in the pan
I brought enough quarters back to go scrimmage with the Rams (let's go)
When it comes to my plug (uh huh)
It won't fit in the sedan
Comparin' us, you can't do it, it's like Timberlands to Vans
Official only, you know that, pistol under the floor mat
Been hated on more than Jesus, locked up more times than Kodak
The pots handy, pitched for my family like Sandy Koufax
Gave my connect a fresh hundred grand and he hand me dope back
Blocks and jail walls to spots on the Billboard (uh)
Posted up in them traps and they knocked until dawn (ayo, who that?)
The foreigns ain't cheap and these watches still cost (skrrt, ah)
Glocks so big, one shot knock your wheels off

Ayo, they think this shit a game, nigga (this shit a game, nigga)

I used to be a man of the people
Hit the clubs and mingle (what up?)
Used to dream one day I'd be fuckin' Pink 
Like a flamingo (Pink)
That was back when I smoked Canibous
Man, but it was tough, 'cause I was a fan of his
So it sucked to hand him his ass, but
Yeah, lookin' back on my feuds
How me and Ja Rule almost got cool
'Cause we shot pool back in '01
Was it '02? I don't know, but
Something told me fuckin' not to
Then we got stuck in high school
I shoved an Oscar up his wazoo

Yeah, but I think of the rappers I slayed and buried like every night
And every career I might've killed, sometimes I say a prayer and I
Wonder is there a heaven for a G? And if so, is the sanctuary nice?
Studios for rap like Coolio, shootin' craps at gangster's paradise

Huh, here a mic, there a mic
Everywhere a mic, share and share alike
But just don't compare alike
Instead of comparin' me, pick a fair fight
Compare me to lightnin', that similarity's strikin'
Compare me to Jaws
Compare me to Manson, Marilyn or Charles
Compare me to Nas, Biggie, or Pac
Do not compare me to that Iggy bitch
Or all this fuckin' Milli Vanilli hip-hop
This is where all that silly shit stops
Compare me to the pistol that triggered this thought
The semi, the Glock, 9 millis get cocked
I'm sending a shot
Don't come around with them floss raps tryna stunt
Compare me to Meek, big wheelies get popped
One by one, compare 'em to scabs, I'm picking them off
They're going home to f*ck Nicki Minaj, aw
Compare me to Diggity-Das, yah
I'm hickity-hitting it raw, ha

In the trailer park (haha)
Told her I'd play the part like Kanan Stark's
Ate her twat like a Tater Tot, oh shit
Get the strap like a trainin' bra
Lunchtime like at eight-o'clock
But Shady's not for the faint of heart
Goin' at these pricks like Lorena Bobbitt
Y'all want drama, we can make a scary movie like Marlon Wayans
Y'all lookin' at the charred remains of Charlamagne tha God
Slim whip, Westside, and Conway are not playin'
I cock back, aim, and I spray ya like (bang)",0
149,in too deep,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648654/Eminem/In+Too+Deep,"""This could never work,"" is what we said at first
But whatever this is, it's working
But we're in two different worlds and (yeah)
I'm not your husband (nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (what?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say this is me without you
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

I'm not happy here (nah), with her (mm)
Rather have you (yeah), rather have me too (ooh)
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there) with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we're just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)

You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, whoa
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""where the f*ck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are gettin' super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheatin' on her with you or cheatin' on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't ever hear us talk
'Cause we both are gettin' sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

I'm not happy here (nah), with her (mm)
Rather have you (yeah), rather have me too (ooh)
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there) with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we're just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)

We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya, starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month, I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so keep it a hunnid, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

I'm not happy here (nah), with her (mm)
Rather have you (yeah), rather have me too (ooh)
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there) with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we're just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)",0

Bucket on low like Erick and Parrish
Closed casket flow, all you niggas get deaded
They don't give you one single rose while you can smell it

Wanna go out in my garden like Godfather

So what you sayin' nigga? You gots to chill (uh-huh)

Back to back with' it, the hardest shit of the year (Nasir Jones)

EPMD, we back in business
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us, come to your senses (uh)
P is the second coming of God something to witness
Piece of shit fly on your head like Mike Pence's
We in the trenches
I'm mad, better yet, I'm on a rampage
My people can't even get minimum wage
F*ck a stimulus (uh)
Give me some interest (uh)
Give me a loan
Give me a home
Get me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome
Best wishes, ghost 'em like he Tommy
Ain't worried bout nothin' 'cause Hit Squad behind me

EPMD, we back in business
I visualize what is it, not what is isn't
We at the mafia table next to the kitchen
Eatin' Michelin Stars, countin' a million

Dun
I let it go for the family, meetin's at Cote in Miami
Them wine bottles on maggie, extra large
Sign up for my masterclass, Escobar
Feet up at Mets Stadium at my restaurant (yerr)
Tied in from AZ to Dave East, you know my thoughts get crazy
My teachers, they couldn't grade me
I know some Haitians in Dade County, got choppers in Haiti
She booked a flight to Colombia, made her body amazin'
Just to post it on Tumblr, this that ""f*ck up the summer"" shit
I don't care what you comin' with, me and Hit-Boy runnin' shit (runnin' shit)
Big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (yeah, flooded now)
Pull up with the Ghost like a haunted house (haunted house)
Shit gettin' scary, blood on my hands like Carrie
Might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
I said it was dead, but it faked its death like Machiavelli
You see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti

Yeah, ready?
EPMD, we're back in business (what?)
Livin' in cramped conditions, we'll give you ammunition
Stock them shelves, I got more shells like Taco Bell and I'm not gon' fail
I got no L's like Christmas, you don't wanna make the claws come out (nah)
Y'all should call yourselves Santa (why?) 'Cause none of y'all are real (nah)
Not a single one (like what?), Like a dollar bill (yeah)
It's like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill
We got her a bond and she'll
Never bail on me, not even outta jail
EPMD, but me, I gots no chills (you gotsa chill)
Just a lotta skrill
Lady, my paper's so crazy, I just tossed a mil' out the window
Of my mobile on the fuckin' freeway on the way here (yeah)
Like Rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
That's a lot of bucks flyin' when I'm makin' it rain, dear
Green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
A pocket full of pills, some are Tylenol 3s, prolly two or three Molly
So some are E which reminds me of rap summary, mami
My theme song, me and P
Always used to play that shit on repeat all day
So please call me ""Big Daddy"" (daddy)
Plus I got the 'caine and lean on me (yeah)
MCs, I'm eatin' you B-I-T-C-H's like tortilla chips
Me, I'm free of debt, yeah, green is on Chia Pet
This is the effects of my old neighborhood misery index
Poverty at it's peak, OCD and PTSD I guess
R.I.P. out to DMX, Stezo, E and Nipsey
Ecstasy and Prince Markie Dee, MF DOOM, I hit 50 via text
Told him that I love him 'cause I don't even know when I'ma see him next (nah)
Tomorrow could be your death (yeah, what?) (Bring that beat back)
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'Cause the brain's iller trained, killer, danger, deranged
And I drank all the DayQuil, I blank on the paper
Then wait 'til the page fill up
Hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
I just pray for the day when I'm able to say that I'm placed
With the greats and my name's with the Kane's and the Wayne's and the Jay's
And the Dre's and the Ye's and the Drake's and the J Dilla's, Jada's, Cool J's
And the Ra's and amazin' as Nas is, and praise to the Gods of this
Shout to the golden age of hip-hop and the name of this song is

151,those kinda nights,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648632/Eminem/Those+Kinda+Nights,"Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
(D.A. got that dope)
It's one of those kinda nights

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' a cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the Motel 8
Yeah, Bizzare's tryna get a lapdance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like, ""Goddamn""
She's like, ""That's harassment""
I'm like, ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a Bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy
She said, ""F*ck off"", and threw her liquor at me
(It's one of those kinda nights)
(Then I said, I said)

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights

This beat keeps takin' me back, like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God, my whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on?"" Ah (haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?"", I said, ""No, I'm high""
I'm checkin' out the chick, she said, ""So am I""
What's in the cup? Let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda 

O-M-G
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Says she wants go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot
Here comes the brigade
Turnt like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay, me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over""
She said, ""No problemo"", windows are dark tint
Roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're hoein'
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no-one
I'm high and you're bi
I'm comin', you're going

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise

166,darkness,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648673/Eminem/Darkness,"I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium
Then chase it with booze, one little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
F*ck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud, but it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound, I should get ready for the show now
Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax and just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack, you can't murder a show nobody's at
But what if nobody shows?
Panic mode 'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show, just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
The press is 'bout to go apeshit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, 'nother Valium fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the Scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
F*ck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin' but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Kaiser Soze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of 'em John Travolta, stayin' alive by inches
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh, f*ck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over, no suicide note
Just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness 
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Yeah, we do have some breaking news from the Associated Press right now

Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
Protect yo' energy from poison when the python strike
My first mistake was doin' robberies on Nikon bikes
Watch my moves and I'ma show you what a icon like
Y'all let bygones be bygones, right?
Nigga, f*ck yo' truce, bust yo' move
And if that nigga touch your shoes
You better blast on 'em and on my mama, nigga
I'ma get that cash on 'em, hunnid on the dash on 'em
Swerve, born from the trench, you from the 'burbs
Nigga, f*ck the early bird, nigga
I'ma get this motherfuckin' chicken
And if a nigga ever got a problem, nigga
We can fuckin' solve it, on my mama, nigga
I just been itchin' to prove myself
I just pray throughout the struggle I don't lose myself
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell
But listen

I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

First and foremost, for every door that's opened, a door close
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road
A dead end, or prison time, where we was headin'
Instead, when I got bread, broke it with brethren
Eyes open, leave the house, move like a veteran
Made a couple dollars from come-ups, my niggas flexin'
Nigga got a problem, then I can make some corrections
Okay, cool, still with the same niggas since grade school
Give a f*ck about your Shade Room when I had made room
For everybody on that late moon, and word to Rae Sremm'
Had to bring the motherfuckin' swank on 'em
And I ain't even wanna have to blank on 'em
That Lamb' truck got a full tank on 'em
But, a nigga better not look at me wrong
It's certain shit that I can't say on this song, but let me tell you, nigga

I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan (yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

I done seen some shit within my lifetime, at one time I
Can still remember just how bad I used to want five mics
My biggest dream was just to make it into Unsigned Hype (word)
It's so hard for me to fathom this was once my life (yeah)
Shit'll make you wanna cop out like a plea deal (yeah)
So I treat a beat like it's Tekashi, spit on that bitch like Meek Mill
My addiction got me weak-willed (yup)
I'm relapsing, I think I can't seem to stop eating Beat Pills
And Doctor D-R-E he still keeps on givin' me refills
Send 'em at me, bullets hit indiscriminately
Women and men and little kids senior citizens 'til the Sig is empty
Whipped Gen-Z into a frenzy, but no gift, is in me, I'm stingy
And that is the motherfuckin' difference between them and me (who?)
And that's the reason I'm, in my Louis Vuitton (what am I?)
Gorier than Eva Long (yeah)
This rap shit, is somethin' that you'll never see me at 
Like senior prom (wait a minute what I mean)
What I mean's the bar's, higher than Cheech and Chong (yeah, wow)
When you give them each a bong (yeah)
I call my stan's a, fan club 'cause whoever it's unleashed upon (what?)
Fuckin' beats up on (bitch), like police batons (y'all are)
Y'all are window shoppers, bunch a Peeping Toms
Still got that bullseye on my back (back), red dot on my head (yeah)
Yeah, blood on my hands for some of the rhymes that I've said (why?)
Police squad on the task
Got 'em hot on my trail, like my stepfather with the belt, I got S.W.A.T. on my ass
I was painfully shy, now I'm proud of myself
Like Obama's kids, I came outta my shell (Michelle)
And I can promise this
On my mama, shit, no daughters, bitch (here we go now)
Yeah, every single word'll be true so with out further adieu
It's return of the ruthless more murderous than Mook is 
So what you're gonna do's think I'm allergic 
When I point this motherfuckin burner at 'chu (ah-choo)
I throw shade it'll be curtains for you
Pray for the verse to get through, birth of a new (yeah)
Worser me, who's determined to do
Permanent damage with the words that I threw 
Bird's-eye view I'm referred to as Zeus
Circlin' you like I'm a vulture features are tournaments, I turn 'em into
Turnin' me loose is like verbal abuse, language hurtful to use cursin' at you
Made a couple of mistakes that occurred in my youth 
Jumped a hurdle or two, word but I'm through
With tellin' you about the food stamps and the government cheese
And how we used to get school lunches for free
Already told ya, 'bout the holes up in my Pony shoes and Rustler jeans
When it was Mother, lil' brother and me
I told you 'bout, being kicked out 20 degrees, no money to eat (yeah)
'Bout the thrift stores and being piss poor 
The Christmases Ma had gifts for us, when bro and me discovered that she
Was wrappin' shit up around the house, to stick it under the tree

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
Adhd, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (ayy, ayy)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster (ayy)
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em, ""Lick the balls""
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster (ayy)
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake) yeah
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
Or being the recievin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hunnid percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

170,shady cxvpher,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/10988/Eminem/Shady+CXVPHER,"My name is KXNG CROOKED, I snap on you rappers often
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we really lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like
B-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam
Like got damn
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop
Van Damme, karate chop
The Baretta's a better competitor
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot
And booku, booku, I'm cookoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapid
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
When I come back, that's it
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I
When I land, you wack niggas die
And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'
With their hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwords so their last words is ?
That's backwards for ""F*ck them damn niggas""
Buck them damn triggers
Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers
Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
But I only like dead rappers
Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to
I gotta cancel you now
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin'
I dwarf giants, I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sorta like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science
That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
That's where the fire's burnin'
Try to deny music's messiah returnin'
You die and you fry in my iron furnace
I am on my get rich and die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis cause I am murderous

(Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey)
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist
And if ain't a bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now
F*ck the cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
So it's f*ck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
Face says I been stressed
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Shit that bothered from the start
Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfathers heart
Yeah, just not decided to be his own
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
Not the how do I feel, not the how do I deal
If that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
But wait, wildest part of all of that is
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But f*ck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done

Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama

My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama
Here's the back story
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills
I don't know which one's which or what it's for
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt
I still drink till I end up being that klutz
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
I'll probably do it tonight
Leave the bar, leave the car
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
For unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar 
Thought it would be
Wait a minute, the lord and the god hate me
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
Nah
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
Wanna take a tour? Let's see
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
Books, bears, trucks, boats, tyres, spares, four-wheelers
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift gets low while there's chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
Ditsy flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass CEO
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
Guess who's coming to dinner?
André 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just a pet to feed of course
Who rides a horse in an ash field? I might
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
And mateys, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
Moonshine, gold watches, gold rings
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat
All the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
I don't know where that came from
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
Don't look under the tarp, sir
I'm growin' weed for my mama there
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley
And I did it my way
See, hip hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out

But these cyphers, I treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
Now they deem me a savior
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, I just really like rap
I'm not lucky, trust me
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky
With the shit that my pen states, these rappers can't touch me
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous
I was better than all you silly kids when I was tryna figure out who I really is
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
No rubber groove on my shoes had to fight, so suspensions
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter
That's 3 to 1, I learned that in public school too
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece",0

My flow all over the place, .44 in the waist
I'm so-so innovative, po-po went away, I roll over 'em and make bacon
And call 'em a pig, won't you hop up off of my dick?
Words in the way, I'm at lost by 'em

Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-ilitants
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern

I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars just like ASMR
All my dogs is at the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call my youngins takin' flight
You a bark, bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo

All combine into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run

They call me five to nine, and thought duh-dun, duh-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out, like the Octo-Mom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist, tryna ball a fist I will
F*ck you just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had to give me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly

My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil

They wanna put my style to the test, am I still

Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented

Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor, with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (pew)

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime, I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic, newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

And I don't think that I can stop it, here it comes
I do my best to try to block it, redrum
I've been sipping on like, vodka, head's numb
I'm blacking out, you better watch it, it's bedlam",0

But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'

Uh, you weren't with me on the cold block nights
Now you front row for the spotlight
Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight
Young nigga on bullshit and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight, could've been a victim of an opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this 'cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many times God tested me, they only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs, tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently, if you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully, I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off so we felt the struggle so painfully

Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'

Yeah, you know the code we gotta live by
Never mind all the ice cubes on this wristwear in the big body
Live by the gun, get bodied or it's hella time in that cell
It was hella times where I failed, when I had to double back from them Ls
Bet he don't double back when he tell
'Cause it ain't no comin' back when you tell
Why would you leave me here by myself? A nigga be lonely
Ayy, I blew the whole bag on they flights, ain't leavin' the homies
If he really gang, then get him a chain, no cubic zirconies
White Zomb' in the stogey, stood firm, never folded
Furthest thing from a rodent, you put the jacket on and you bogus
Yeah, big dawg and they know it
I had to spin off to stay focused
Longev' on the motion
We don't abandon ship when it's hopeless
I done been broke before and they know

I make it look easy
Like I made it overnight
I make it look easy
But you don't see the dark side
And all of the monsters I had to fight (fight)
And all of the nightmares (nightmares)
Made me stronger than life (yeah)

Y'all say (what?), I've changed (huh)
Really, though? (Tell me), how so? (I got)
Got all (what?), this bread (yeah)
I'm still (what?), sour though (huh)
I don't know (I'm a), square peg (in a), round hole (yeah)
Like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
Rocky Balboa (I), never been no (what?), towel thrower
Even when I got kicked to the curb (yeah)
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment and hurt
To an unquenchable thirst, in the simplest terms
It's revenge of the nerd, in every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength and resilience (nah)
How I rack my brain but it feels as if I'm tryna explain it to children (damn)
So a lot of this pain isn't healin', no escapin' it, this anger is spilling
Almost like recreatin' a feelin' of 9/11 when the second plane hit the building
So let 'em paint you the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom (yeah)
Of havin' way too much income (mmm)
But when you struggled every day just to get some (yeah)
Now all of this hate is a syndrome (yuh)
When they can't relate, and that stems from (what?)
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green but those aren't leaves (leaves)
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and pray
Had to claw, scratch and fight my way
Just follow me, and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey (Skylar Grey)
And rappers, how can we be on the same level now
When I gotta look down and see these clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP to the height of 2003 me
You ain't see the struggle to make it out the D
Because I made it somehow look easy

Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (oh-oh-oh)

Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot, oh yeah

That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks
She gets her mou—ahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for shit to quiet down
He'll just gas his plane up, and fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the fuckin' nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his fuckin' rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he can not withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
F*ck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin', ""Drain the swamp!""
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in–
–stead of talkin' Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
'Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignorin' our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, ""You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!""
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespectin' the military
F*ck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!
""He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!""
""He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!""
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm usin' all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
F*ck you!
The rest of America, stand up!
We love our military, and we love our country
But we fucking hate Trump!",0

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shh to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
F*ck an acid tab, I strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mamas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure",0

In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin')

Let's pretend like its '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream 
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone)

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
F*ck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell

Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat
Incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Hoo, Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine
And you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Whoa
Whoa, ah
Whoa

You're so fine
And you're mine
I'll be yours
'Till the end of time
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin, hey
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Like a virgin, ooh ooh
Like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me,
And your heart beats,
And you love me

Oh oh, ooh whoa
Oh oh oh whoa
Whoa oh ho, ho

Ooh baby

It's um Madonna (Mamacita) that's right!

Quiere estar soltera
Nadie la enamora
Por que está tan buena
Que prefiere estar sola que mal acompañada

Ella es así nadie la va a cambiar
Es reservada no da el celular
A ningún hombre le piensa copiar
Ella anda suelta y no le va a bajar

I told you not to waste your time
I'm not a girl you drink like wine
If you press pause then I'll retreat
I will not grovel at your feet
Please don't fall in love with me
I would rather be set free
I can not give you my all
I will not make my self small
For no one

Anybody, body, body
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body
En el party, party, party
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body

Quiere estar soltera
Nadie la enamora
Por que está tan buena
Que prefiere estar sola que mal acompañada

Ella es así nadie la va a cambiar
Es reservada no da el celular
A ningún hombre le piensa copiar
Ella anda suelta y no le va a bajar

Don't you try to rescue me
I'm who I'll always be
And I rather be alone
Than pretend to make a perfect doll

I told you not to waste your time
I'm not a girl you drink like wine
If you press pause then I'll retreat
I will not grovel at your feet, so

Anybody, body, body
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body
En el party, party, party
Se pone creativa así luciendo su body

Se mueve pa' arriba, pa'l centro, pa' dentro
Mueve caderas, que me tiene enfermo
Tú sabes muy bien cual es el movimiento
Dale pa' aca, pa' aca, pa' aca
Entre más te acercas más rico te siento
Sube las manos y mueve tu cuerpo
Tú sabes bien cual es el movimiento
Dale pa' atra' pa atra, pa' atra'

And don't you forget it ciao papi
And don't you forget it ciao papi
You are going to regret it
Yeah ciao papi
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
Ciao papi",1

I am not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe you
God is on my side and I'll be fine
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie, the wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life",1

And it feels like home

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there

I went back to my 17 year
Allowed myself to be naive (Dime)
To be someone I've never been (Me encanta)
I took a sip and had a dream
And I woke up in Medellín (¿Te gusta?)
The sun was caressing my skin (Dime)
Another me could now begin (Woo)

Tranquila, baby, yo te apoyo
No hay que hablarnos mucho para entrar en rollo
Si quieres ser mi reina pues yo te corono
Y pa' que te sientes aquí tengo un trono
Te gusta cabalgar, eso está claro
Si sientes que voy rápido le bajo
Discúlpame, yo sé que eres Madonna

Mucho que me asusta (por eso no te vas)

Llegó a la disco montando
Terror con sus amigas
es lo que le gusta
Ella es la reina de su combo y nada la intimida
Es que es la más dura

Solo utiliza Chanel
Qué lo bien lo combina con su joya Cartier
Dicen que su exnovio la dejó por infiel
Le gustan menores como yo, se le ve

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene

Bitch, I'm loca (y yo loco, loco)
Bésame la boca (¿Yytú qué me das?) (Ay)
Bitch, me gusta (y yo te provoco)
Mucho que me asusta (por eso no te vas)

Luego no te quejes cuando muerda esa boquita
I like to be on top, ver cómo te excitas (bye bye bye)

I'm not so sure that you can manage this type of entertainment
I've had a Latin boy and truth, there was a bit of damage
Somehow, I think you like that
Let's see if you can last
Forget about the future and we have no past
I like the way you move, you know you're just my type
I guess you like a crazy girl, but it's alright

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene, yeah yeah

Bitch, I'm loca (y yo loco, loco, loco) (tranquila)
Besame la boca (¿Y tú qué me das?) (Venga, baby)
Bitch, me gusta (y yo te provoco)
Mucho que me asusta (por eso no te vas) (ay, ay, papi)

Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca (ay)
Ella es mi loca, loca y yo soy loco, loco (ay, ay, papi)
Bitch, I'm loca, lo-lo-lo-loca (lo-lo-loca)
Pero si me pide yo soy loco, loco (ay, ay, papi)

I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me want to hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Open your heart, I'll make you love me
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying, you've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key

Open your heart, I'll make you love me (C'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (I'm gonna give it to you)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, c'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (Ow, c'mon baby)
It's not that hard, if you just turn the key (Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out)
Open your heart, I'll make you love me (I'm gonna give it to you)

Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie, I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run

And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Respect yourself, hey, hey

Baby, you're mine on a platter

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known

I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

This way

I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do, I don't want to feel blue

208,bye bye baby,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35736992/Madonna/Bye+Bye+Baby,"This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me
You're thinking of me
But we're never together

[Chorus:]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

[Chorus:]

You're so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say bye bye

[Chorus:]

I don't want to keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowin' in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adios

Uh, this is not a love song
I'd like to hurt you

What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

The first time and the last time
You can forget about it baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it baby, bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
You fucked it up",1

This masquerade is getting older
Light are low, the curtains down
There's no one here (There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around (No one around)
Watching you, watching me,
One lonely star (One lonely star you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

Say good-bye (Bye bye), say good-bye

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile,
All the world loves a clown (Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played (Role that you played)
No more masquerade,
You're one lonely star (One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why oh why

All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart

I've always been in love with you (I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why oh why
The show is over, say good-bye

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)

Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

216,oh what a circus,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34817641/Madonna/Oh+What+a+Circus,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina peron
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention
Unless we all are, I think we all are
So share my glory, so share my coffin
So share my glory, so share my coffin

It's our funeral too",1

Certainties disappear
What do we do? For our dream to survive?
How do we keep, all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me

To make me fantastic, I have to be rainbow high
In magical colors

You're not decorating a girl for a night on the town
And I'm not a second-rate queen getting kicks with a crown

Next stop will be Europe
The rainbow's gonna tour, dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show

Look out, mighty Europe
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me

Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide 
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

Oh, sing hallelujah
Oh, save my soul
Oh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said oh, sing hallelujah
Oh, save my soul
Oh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told 

Until my story's told",1

So pop the hood and see what's good I need to a toolin' man
My precious love I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thumpin' on the lot

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

Stuck to the seat our body heat, what will you do with those ice
This should get outta here, was steppin' on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're gone past, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

I'll work on the engine
Like we blew a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die it's true

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

I hear you work in a body shop",1

You said I was your queen

And now you want your freedom

You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
And I'm no longer needed

You sad I was over wanted it to end
Than you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak city
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
You never gained the best of me
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me
'Cause I'm in heartbreak city

You tore me into pieces
You didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess

I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You sad I was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

Built me up and I can do no wrong

I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache I'm gonna carry on

I deserve the best and it's not you

I've fallen apart, I was lost, now I'm found
I picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven and let me fall down

Lifted me up and watched me stumble

225,rebel heart,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/34385921/Madonna/Rebel+Heart,"I live my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say ""told you so, told you so""
Why can't you be like the other girls
I said, oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me
All of the things I did, just to be seen",1

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how

I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call 
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Ring ring ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but there's no one home
Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hanging up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me
Cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it will be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby night and day
I'm fed up
I'm tired of waiting on you.",1

I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead

Is always Mister Right

And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world

Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend
Everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy
That's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby
Time to come undone

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control

Couldn't wait to get older
Thought I'd have so much fun
Guess I'm one of the grown-ups
Now I have to get the job done
People give me the business
I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos
Gotta get away from here

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how, I'm ready now

Slow down you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

Where's the party
Where's the party, someone tell me
Where's the party, come on, come on, come on

To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away

Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power

Keep people together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together
Keep people together forever, together

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I want to be different, I want to be on my own
But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just givin' to get something
Always wanting something back
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance

Keep, keep it together forever, keep it together
Keep people together forever, together

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

248,in this life,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35470128/Madonna/In+This+Life,"Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

What for?
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself

I'm non compos mentes,
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist,
For I'm non compos mentes.

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat,
That makes me gonzo.
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas,
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas
For I'm going bananas.

I'm going meshuga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing ""Booga wooga"",
But I'm going meshuga.

There's bats in my belfry.
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight,
Otherwise I might get myself free.
Yes, there's bats in my belfry.

Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think,
That makes me gonzo.
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas,
Someone get me a bed in the ""Casa de Loco"" for all my mananas,
For I'm going bananas.
Yes, I'm going bananas.
Si, I'm going bananas.",1
250,waiting for tonight,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33451917/Madonna/Waiting+for+Tonight,"Like a movie scene in the sweetest dreams
I had pictured us together
Now to feel your lips on my fingertips
I have to say is even better

Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever

I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter

Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan

This time I'm not only getting
I'm holding my man",1

Scarred and we're bruised but our hearts will guide us
Together I know no one else is gonna last forever
You're gonna be alright, tonight

We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane

Together, we're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide, this is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
I never admit it
But it hurts

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be war but I'm not going down

One little lie I can ruin my day
Words are like weapons they betray
When I am afraid, one word of kindness it can save me

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out

Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day I won't care
But for the moment I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes, and let you catch me now

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out

Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

I thought awhile, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it
Then you let it go
See you tryin' to call me, but I blocked you on the phone
It took a minute, but now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you sayin' that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

Did you?
You know you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, f*ck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

I know you'd like it if I stayed home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, did it, loved it, hated it
I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
You know you never really knew how much you loved me 'til you lost me

It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope or Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not trying to s-stack for cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on a golden cat

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets inside
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)

It's the enlightenment that started it all
The founding fathers wrote it down on a wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turn right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

Behind the curtain of the new world order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the phoenix, pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not Google of the United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Ban
Or anyone you love to hate

The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, truth and light
The all-seeing eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secrets inside
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)
It's like everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati (woh woh woh woh)

You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
Come on, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight (tonight, to-tonight, tonight, tonight)

Could be shattered in a second
You can fled a needle with the cheer of from my eyes
It should injustice to be with this, two of things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me

From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I

Feel the chill as we kiss, don't forget

All you had as dreams, don't hold back
All the fantasies you ever had
Just do what you like, go ahead
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets

I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Lose your self-control, we can go wild
Show you what it means to feel alive
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Surrender to the pleasure (wanting)
When we breath in together (waiting)
It's either now or never (for you)
This feeling will take over

No sex tapes, no camera (wanting)
Just you and me together (waiting)
Repeat it like a mantra (for you)
I'm in love, I'm in love

I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

265,veni vidi vici,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31799410/Madonna/Veni+Vidi+Vici,"Life was so crazy
You've been through a lot
I tell you stories some times you know

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize, my every single move
But then I realized, I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise, when I became the news

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark

I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

(Talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say your little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a f*ck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two 
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybpdy
And trapster, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messaiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

I conquered
I conquered

Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watch me burn with a fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist
Put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil
Watch you slither away

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

See I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart

Why can't you be like the other girls

And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me

I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Boo doo bee doo

Santa honey, I wanna yacht and really that's
Not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, there's one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking with a duplex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Boo doo bee doo

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean a phone

Hurry down the chimney tonight

But most of all because I love Thee,
And I want so badly to be good

The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But i'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild

Hey Britney, are you ready, uh-huh, are you?

When no one cares
It's whipping my hair

To hell with stares
The sweat is dripping all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancing up in this place
Tonight I'm here
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass

But you painted me bad
Compared to the others

And if I see that bitch in hell
I'm gonna shoot him in the head again
'Cause I wanna see him die

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

Time goes by so slowly

This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the WIFI
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweetin on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don't give a

You were so mad at me
Whos got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didnt have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers:
""Baby Jesus"" on the stairs
Gotta sign the contract
Gotta get my money back
All the biters have to go
Standing in the front row

You don't hear them bums on nothin' that's fire

In that, yeah Gabbana, and the, ah yeah, Prada
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a ""F"" you
Curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you

Stay behind your velvet rope

And I'm right by your side

I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seem to me is what you're like
The ""look but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side

And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near

He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works, I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men

But have tested those who call themselves apostles
But are not and found them to be false
I know that you are enduring patiently
And bearing out for my namesake

And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned the love you had

I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews but they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping, praying for you to justify my love

And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bears

And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne, and great authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshiped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshiped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""

And the beast was given a
Mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against God

It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain

If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping

Then, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them and they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them

He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For these things will have passed away

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone""

And he said to me, he said to me
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near, let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy""

""Behold, I am coming soon
I am the alpha and the omega
The first and the last
The beginning and the end""

And silence me with bitterness and lies

It's human nature (Would it sound better if I were a man?)
And I'm not sorry (You're the one with the problem)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (Why don't you just deal with it)

And I'm not sorry (Would you like me better if I was?)
It's human nature (We all feel the same way)
And I'm not sorry (I have no regrets)
I'm not your bitch don't hang your shit on me (Just look in the mirror)

And I'm not sorry (I don't have to justify anything)

291,love spent,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946748/Madonna/Love+Spent,"You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you have married me if I were poor
Yes, if I was your treasury
You’d have found a time to treasure me

How come you can’t see
All that you need
Is right here with me

Up until the end
All this pretend
Wasn’t for free

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me
Now you have your money
Spend it til there’s nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

If we opened up a joint account
Would it put an end to all your doubt
Frankly if my name was Benjamin
We wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in

You played with my heart
Till death do we part
That’s what you said
Now you have your fast cars
Women and bars
It’s gone to your head

Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me
Love me like your money
Spend it til there’s nothing
Spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold on to it
Till there’s nothing left

Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah I’m love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms
Until there’s nothing left (nothing left, nothing left)

Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I’m love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah I’m love spent
Really love spent
Wondering where it all went

I want you to take me
Like you took your money
Take me in your arms
Until your last breath

I want you to hold me
Like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms
Until there’s nothing left (nothing left, nothing left)",1
292,nobody knows me ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946747/Madonna/Nobody+Knows+Me+%28Video+Interlude%29,"I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died

I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like-like you know me, like-like-like

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup, and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

Nobody knows me
(It's no fun but the damage is done) Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like, like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me

Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)

293,i'm addicted,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30946746/Madonna/I%27m+Addicted,"When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can’t get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I’d write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

Feels like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love
(I’m addicted to your love)
(I’m addicted to your love)

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It’s like MDMA and that’s OK

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don’t care if you think that I’m strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I’m ready to take this chance
I need to dance

Your name's like a drug
And I can’t get enough
And it fits like a glove
I’m addicted to your love

I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your...
I’m addicted, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to your love

Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
(Think about it)
Doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Feel my temperature rising
It's too much heat
I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher?
Get closer to the fire
I don't what you're waiting for

[Chorus]
I'm gonna party 
(Yeah)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(Yeah)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you got a reputation 
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show ya
That if it feels right
Get on your mark
Step to the beat boy
That's what its for

Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside 
But for now just come here
Let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

I'm gonna party 
(It's a celebration)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(No more hesitation)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance?
Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on
What are you waiting for?

I'm gonna party

'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started

'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Come join the party

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

301,girl gone wild ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26785726/Madonna/Girl+Gone+Wild+%5BAlbum+Version%5D+%5BVersion%5D,"Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven, and the pains of hell
But most of all because I love Thee,
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them eight o eight drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

A girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

The room is spinning
It must be the tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like smokin' gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know
I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know
Good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But i'm a bad girl, anyway
Forgive me

Hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey
Like a girl gone wild
A good girl gone wild

Girls they just wanna have some fun

303,in america ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/29144646/Madonna/In+America+%5BPerformance+Track+with+Demonstration+Vocals%5D+%5BIn+the+Style,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die",1

We pass by the same old place you are a (beautiful killer)
You don’t have a life, you have blood on your hands
You can sleep at night and I don’t understand
I don’t know much about you are a wanted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Do you know the reasons why you are a beautiful killer?
Hurt yourself but you never die, you are a (beautiful killer)
I like your silhouette when you stand on the streets
Like a samurai you can handle the heat
Makes me wanna pray for a haunted man

You can call my name and I’ll be a around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about
'Cause your a beautiful killer with beautiful eyes
A beautiful killer and I love your disguise

You changed the past
Good guys always finish last
What happens now?
I need to know how the story goes
Are we together?
I love you forever

You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
You can call my name and I’ll be around
Maybe I’ll let you shoot me down
'Cause you’re a beautiful killer with a beautiful face
A beautiful killer and you won’t leave a trace

Can’t really talk with a gun in my mouth
Maybe that’s what you been dreaming about

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept my big mouth closed
I could have just done what I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you
I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say

You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
Do you wanna know how to make out loud
Telling your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Fill it up with Warhols
It would be so cool
Coulda gone buyin' estates in the countryside
With a pack of great things
Kissing eye to eye
We coulda do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We coulda found a mountain seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda got a building built on the echo run
We coulda got ourselves arrested and sold our mum
We coulda live like crazy til' the day we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Je suis desole
I wish I could take you back but I can't

Nobody does it better than myself

I feel an ache I’d kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure so sure I’d struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark

See our hearts are intertwined
Then I’m free, free of mine
I’m falling free

And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love

And when you lift you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over Hope and Love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again

When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, free to go
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go",1

313,i fucked up,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26272491/Madonna/I+Fucked+Up,"I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back, but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept
my big mouth closed
I could have just done
what I was told
Maybe I should turned silver into gold
But in front of you I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back, but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I though we were indestructible
I never imagine we could fall
You wanna know how to make a laugh
Telling your plans

We could've bought a house with a swimming pool,
End it up with walls, It would be so cool,
Could've gone by the s in the country sides,
With a back of great things, kissing eye to eye

We could've do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We could've find a mountain in a perfect sun set,
Writing out names across the sky
We could've got a building built in the echo run
We could've got a sales in west and sold out mount
We coulda live like crazy til the days we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
Je suis d'sol'e
I wish I could take you back, but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back maybe one day",1

315,love makes the world go round,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964716/Madonna/Love+Makes+the+World+Go+Round,"Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

We've got to take a stand (Love makes the world go round)
Love makes the world go round
(If you don't hear the sound) Love makes the world go round)

Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round

Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round

316,la isla bonita ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964714/Madonna/La+Isla+Bonita+%5BExtended+Remix%5D,"Como puede ser verdad
 
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama",1

Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Oh no baby my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Don't go givin' me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run seem to have all the fun
But are you wasting my time -- she's so fine
Are you just being kind

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
That's how I feel, don't fog my mind

Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
That this is not a love song that I want to sing",1

You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't,
'Cause you don't love me no more

You need so much but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that, she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is true, when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't, if you don't

You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay, here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that, she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore

He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts the fight, she starts the lie
But what is true when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

She's had enough, she says the end
But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again
Till death do us part",1
319,promise to try,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964709/Madonna/Promise+to+Try,"Little girl don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try, it's not the same

Keep your head held high, ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss, kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try, but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on, but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye, but I promise to try",1

Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons, for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade, dear Jessie
Hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade",1

Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling, I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand; at least he was a man

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?

To confess my sins, to do penance, to amend my life,

Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion",1

Swim to the ocean floor

Students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't want to carry anymore
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Let the water wash over you
Wash all over you
Swim to the ocean floor
So that we can begin again
Wash away all our sins
Crash to the other shore
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't want to carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home

I'll never be the same
Because of you

All comes back to me

It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one

I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light

You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Nothing really matters

Everything I give you (Everything I give you)
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

Fate fits karma so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go

Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

Hand fits giving so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be

Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as they go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as I go

When your heart's not open

You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mm, we'd never be apart
Mm, give yourself to me
Mm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Creation comes when you learn to say no

You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do ya wanna go higher?

There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good bye

Your heart is not open so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good bye

Learn to say good bye
I yearn to say good bye

There's nothing left to try

Anything to make me want to stay

To kiss but never be
The object of your desire

335,mer girl,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964690/Madonna/Mer+Girl,"I ran from my house
That cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me
Even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops
I ran to the sky
Out to the lake
Into the rain
That matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and ran
I was looking for me
I ran past the churches
And the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards
And the lady that never talks
Up into the hills
I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath
And thought about your death
I ran to the lake
Up into the hills
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All the forgotten names
I tasted the rain
I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels
I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
The black sky opened up
Blinding me

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran
I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes
And up to the hill
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I smelt her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay

I ran and I ran
I'm still running away",1

Silky
Smooth lips as sweet as candy
Baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

Strong inside but you don't know it
Good little girls
They never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak could you be a little weak

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl

Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently
Baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show and tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best could you be a little less

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl

Do you know what it feels like for a girl

348,i love new york,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/27964677/Madonna/I+Love+New+York,"I don't like cities
But I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork

Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby you can keep

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad
Except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

If you don't like my attitude
Then you can F off
Just go to Texas
Isn't that where they golf?

New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat
Then get off my street
Get off of my street
Get off my street
You get off of my street
Get off my street
You get off of my street
Get off my street
Just get off my street

Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad

Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture

There was a boy
And there was a girl

Just one touch from your hands

We seal the destiny forever

Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain

There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world

Should I carry on?

Just about everything

Whether they were good or bad

And it doesn't make much sense

Don't let the fruit rot
Under the vine
Fill up your cup
And let's drink the wine

356,american pie,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28998331/Madonna/American+Pie,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die",1

363,angel,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022442/Madonna/Angel,"Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel baby

You abandoned me

Just a vacancy

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

Just a vacancy

You're the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd ya have to go away (away)
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love

I wanted more than just a one night stand
He had a way of making me believe
That he was mine and that he'd never leave

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why

And when he danced with me I know he wanted more
But in the dark things happened much too fast
I should've stopped him then, I knew it wouldn't last

I know that I should take my friend's advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice

My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it
If I'm in charge and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to

Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain
I can see you understand
I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way

I know you want me

I'm not gonna hurt you, just close your eyes

370,deeper and deeper,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022407/Madonna/Deeper+and+Deeper,"Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do",1
371,where life begins,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022406/Madonna/Where+Life+Begins,"I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about

I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you
In case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
""Finger lickin' good""
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood
Are you still hungry
Aren't you glad you came
I'm glad you brought your rain coat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you, go down
Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is

Where it's warm inside, go down
Where I cannot hide, go down
Where all life begins, go down
That's where my love is
That's where my love is
Come inside, that's where all life begins
It's warm inside",1

That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings like you are now
What happened? What do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (just waiting)

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (just waiting)

Break my heart (waiting for you)
You broke my heart
You broke my heart (waiting for you, just waiting)

A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation (words)
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information (I've grown tired of your words)
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words",1

(Did you do it?) I said I did it
(Did you do it?) I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

(Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you)

Uh, Ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walkin' around showing off their hinies
Wigglin' they're jigglin' they're swingin' and flingin'
9-7-0 Yo Ho, your phone's ringin'
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chillin' in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinnin', you drunk too much gin in
Your jaw starts grinnin', and this is the beginnin'
Of a night of an average Ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (so what did you do)
I took 'er to my place (yo, did she sit on your face)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screamin', nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

They come with the rough stuff, boy we hit it, split it, and forget it
In the same order as ya hear, boy I'm not frontin'
Me not front, don't ask what, me tell ya the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get busy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different 'fros
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turnin' up my stereo

(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
(Did you do it?) You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
(Did you do it?) Yo, you know I did it
(Did you do it?) No more, I said I did it
(Did you do it?) Yo
I backed out quick because I thought I split it

(You didn't do it, he didn't do it)
I made her go

Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you

Waiting for you, just waiting

376,secret garden,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022397/Madonna/Secret+Garden,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
It's in my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden",1

The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

You'll always be inside of my heart
Inside of me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down

I will always have you, inside of me

These are my eyes, but they cannot see
These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness
And loneliness has never been a stranger to me, but

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow
This is my voice, but it's telling lies
I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness
And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to break me

And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

Love tried to welcome me

Covered with dust and sin

Who needs the sky, when the ground's open wide
It's here in your arms I want to be buried

Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth
Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

Who needs the sun (With fluid steps)
Who needs the sky (Around the globe)
Who needs to sleep (I hear your voice)

Is it for free

Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend

I do yoga and pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out their bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm diggin' on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied

I'd like to express my extreme point-of-view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

390,nothing fails,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26022356/Madonna/Nothing+Fails,"I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you, you silly thing
Just take it from me

It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
Nothing fails

I'm not religious

But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here

I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me want to pray

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause you're the one

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved (But I feel so moved)
Makes me wanna pray (But I feel so moved)
Pray you'll always be here

I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna play)
But I feel so moved
I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna play)
Makes me wanna pray (Makes wanna play)

I'm not religious
But I feel so moved (Makes me wanna)
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray (Makes me wanna)

Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly

I want to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I want to save his life

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

Sometimes it's such a pleasure
Sometimes I want to tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know
There is nothing to fear
And I know that love
Will take us away from here

In the blink of an eye everything could change
Say hello to your life, now you're living
This is it from now on
It's a brand new day
It was time to wake up from this dream (from this dream)

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
You'll never be the same

And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will change us forever
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will keep us together (that love, that love)

And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will change us forever

There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

When I touch the ground I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home

I want to let go of all disappointment
That's waiting for me

Not defined by time and space
It's a lonely place

I can't pretend to be someone else

When she told me that you where her best friend
And now she's rolling rolling rolling
And you where stolen stolen stolen
She started dressing like me and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast
And love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment
'Cause she don't have what's ours

She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It wont be the same (it won't be the same)

I should have seen the sign when you weren't here
Under a different light it's oh so clear
She was stealing stealing stealing
And now your feeling feeling feeling
She started dying her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She's started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie

I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast
And love you in the shower

She's not me
If you spend some more time I guarantee we are fine
She's not me

I know I can do it better
If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up all the things you like
You gonna have to watch your...

It won't be the same (it wont be the same)

Never let you forget (She's not me)
She's Not Me and she'll never will be (repeat 2x)

Gotta find a new way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit say you love me love me
Guess my expectations hit the ceiling
When you come back it will cost us trust, trust me

Catch me from across the floor

I'm fallin' for your love in the worst way

So move closer
I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more

And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's do ourselves to the world

Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on

In our zone
Do you wanna take it further
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep runnin' this race

I'm so into you...
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

You don't have to be beautiful

You don't have to be rich and famous

You'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises
They cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars
There's something you should know
The angels they surround my heart
Telling me to let you go

I bet he couldn't
I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it
Who am I to criticize
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away.
Over and over I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now it's over, NO more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
I do, I do

You almost fooled yourself this time
That all the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile
And you keep your lost heartbreaks
The steps that edge along the ledge
Is much higher than it seems
That I've been on that ledge before
You can't hide yourself from me

I bet he couldn't
I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it
Who am I to criticize
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

It's like over and over you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away.
Over and over I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over you can lie to me right through your smile

Now it's over, NO more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
I do, I do

It's like over and over you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away.
Over and over I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over you can lie to me right through your smile
I've seen behind your eyes
Now it's over, NO more intoxicating my mind

Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you

Treat me like a curse
And tell me I'm your savior
I'll never know the stranger
I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

First you say you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you
When you sold it to yourself

Are you walking the dog, 'cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control, is that dog walking you
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand

Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you're playing 'round, like it's on rewind
You blew it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you

This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all
You believed in me, I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do? For our dream to survive?
How do we keep, all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me",1

Because you're miles away

You don't know what you're thinking about 

You're not right all of the time
Its funny when you're wrong 

You're miles away, no one can stop me
So far, it's funny when you're falling over 

You're the robot voice, and the people's choice
Yeah, you blink and it goes wrong
Because you're miles away
You're not even warm, human after all
You don't know what you're talking about

So far, it's funny when you're falling over, oh! 

I'm too skint to pay my debtors
Uh-oh un-opened letters
Feels like a siege I'm under
How did you get my number?
Oh oh, it's for the better
Than on the never ever
I'll get back and back and back
And back and back and back, around we go 

You're miles away, no one can stop me

It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat.
I have truth on my side,
You only have deceit

I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive,

Look around everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (life that you know)

When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey

Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow)
You know you can do it

All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (that's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (open up the door)

It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it

Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body groove to the music (move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue (vogue)
Let your body go with the flow (go with the flow)

Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it

That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical, life's a ball
So get up on the dance floor

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes

You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child

No end and no beginning
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

420,don't cry for me argentina,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/19303633/Madonna/Don%27t+Cry+for+Me+Argentina,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you.
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true",1

427,for america,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32880320/Madonna/For+America,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die",1

Wear shirts and boots 'cause it's okay to be a boy

Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl

And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

439,sidewalk talk,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/15041581/Madonna/Sidewalk+Talk,"Watch where you walk 'cause the sidewalks talk
And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it everyone will know

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

[Chorus]
Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak 'cause you gotta 'long the street
They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been mislead by the things you've said

[Chorus]

When you're living on the street
Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home

[Repeat: x3]
You can do it, uh huh

You can do it

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold

You better think twice when you cross the ice

When you're shedding a tear sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

440,what can you lose? ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26151742/Madonna/What+Can+You+Lose%3F+%5B%23%5D,"What can you lose?
Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her
What can you lose?

But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her
What if she had to choose?

Leave it alone
Hold it all in
Better a bone
Don't even begin
With so much to win
There's too much to lose",1
441,more ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/26151738/Madonna/More+%28End+Credits%29+%5B%23%5D,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
[More! More!]

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
[More! More!]

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
[Except all, all, all]
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all [have it all]
You may find all else above [find all else above]
That though things are bliss,
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!",1

So young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
You were just a backstreet girl
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting

All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?

From the gutter theatrical

So famous so easily, so soon

Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

You're a man with a gun in your hand,
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, I would never let you go.

447,confessions ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/9985090/Madonna/Confessions+%5BLive%5D,"I have a tale to tell

I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard
That it sends your body flying across the room
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge, isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world, I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside he loved me

It was a time I suffered so much
I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms, not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain
That was eating me inside, nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and it invades me

I believe we are messengers on earth
I believe in Angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much
To become who I am today

Now you have to realize not only do I have a family
But now I have a whole hood and that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang, I just wanted to fit in

But one day I was forced to do something
That made me open my eyes and realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said you know what to do really, it's time to get poppy for the hood

That was not to kill anybody",1

Dice are rolling, the knives are out
Would-be presidents are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground

(Eva:)
It doesn't matter what those morons say
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only twenty of them anyway
What is twenty next to millions who
Are looking to you?

All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll...you'll be handed power on a plate
When the ones who matter have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree to be called

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment, and that is why
All exiles are distinguished, more important, they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay

(Eva:)
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide, there's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be denied

(Eva:)
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems, he shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(Workers:)
A new Argentina, the workers' battle song
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Rings out loud and long

(Eva:)
Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me

(All:)
A new Argentina, a new age about to begin
A new Argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within

(Peron:)
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive

(Eva:)
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the Big Apple

But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country

(Eva:)
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?

(All:)
A new Argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new Argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied

(Che:)
How annoying that they have to fight elections for their cause
The inconvenience, having to get a majority
If normal methods of persuasion fail to win them applause
There are other ways of establishing authority

A new Argentina, the voice of the people

Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much

(Aide #2:)
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
(Che:)
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard
(Aide #1:)
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you

But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card

Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts

There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?
(Che:)
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why
(Eva:)
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!
(Italian admiral:)
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
(Aide #2:)
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
(Che:)
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
(Aide #1:)
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye
(chorus)
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is ...
(Che:) A qualified
(Aides:) Yes
(Che:)
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
(Che:)
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now
(Aide #1:)
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow
(Che:)
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required
(chorus)
(Aide #2:) Would Evita win through?
(Aide #1:) And the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) No
(chorus)
(Aides:) Would Evita win through? But the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Aide #1:) Yes
(Aide #2:) Yes",1

I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time

Remember I was very young then
And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?
I saw the lights, and I was on my way

And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

The choice was yours and noone else's
You can cry for a body in despair
Hang your head because she is no longer there
To shine, to dazzle, or betray
How she lived, how she shone
But how soon the lights were gone

Eyes, hair, face, image
All must be preserved
Still life displayed forever
No less than she deserved.",1

Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right

At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me, all you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time:
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina...

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true",1

Give me comfort in your arms

No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

Pulse through my body, igniting my mind

Lawyers suck it up
Didn’t have a pre-nup

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free

Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad

I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever

It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway

Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame, I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy it's time to move on

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

We had, we had, we had, we had
(Are you listening?)
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought, we'd be happily forever

I'd always thought (what you want her to do?) now here I am
I'd always thought (why can't you listen?) we'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway

I'm looking for, I'm looking for mercy (looking for, looking for, looking for mercy)

487,goodbye to innocence,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/3952434/Madonna/Goodbye+to+Innocence,"I don't wanna say goodbye

There are some who believe that I owe them something
But they're wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself
And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there, I am to blame

Chorus:

Say goodbye to anonymity
I have to [have to, have to] say goodbye
To privacy, but most of all
To innocence (repeat 3 times)

My life is not a game that I play to entertain you
And if you can do it better, then you're welcome to my fame
I'm not gonna waste my time correcting myths and rumors
You believe what you wanna believe

(chorus)

I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't need a reason to cry
Kinda makes me wanna
Kinda makes me hafta

Stop and think about it (repeat 3 times)
Do I want to?

I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting down and up]

Up-up, d-d-down, up-up-up

I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting up and down]

Up-up, d-d-down, up-up-up

Listen up
It always comes down to this (repeat)

Some people have a snake at the base of their spine
That would suck out your life, that would take all your time
They're called feeders
They're not believers but you must not fear it
They're takers

You know you better stop, stop and think about it (repeat 3 times)

Your innocence (repeat 3 times)

I don't wanna say goodbye to innocence
I don't need a reason to cry, innocence

Hold on to your innocence
Hold on [hold on, hold on], hold on to innocence
Hold on

Stop and think about it, say goodbye, think about it (repeat twice)",1
489,it's so cool,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30372493/Madonna/It%27s+So+Cool,"It's so hard to be someone,
it's so hard to be unkwown.
In your heart you are to blame
in your heart you play the game.

Do you realize you pay the price?
Do you know the cost of all your vice?
Save your soul, it's all a test,
save your soul, it's for the best.

We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)

Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, dear little brother.
You need hope, says the preacher,
learn to cope says all my teachers.

Do you really know God's intention?
Do you ever ask what it's all for?
We need love, love and love,
we need more, more and more.

We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)

We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)

Prophets are telling us
We're near the end
But I am telling you
that it's all pretend.

It's so cool to be uncool,
it's so right to be unright.
It's so good to look so bad,
isn't this the best thing you ever had.

It's so cool to be uncool,
it's so right to be unright.
It's so good to look so bad,
isn't this the best thing you ever had.

We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)

We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)",1
