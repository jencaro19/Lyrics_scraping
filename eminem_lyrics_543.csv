543,bang,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36400765/Eminem/Bang,"Yeah (brr)
Uh
(Brr, brr, brr)
(Brr, brr, brr)
Machine
(Brr)
It's not a game, nigga (brr, brr)
It's not a fuckin' game, nigga (brr, brr, brr)
Look, look

Ayo, I use the Arm & Hammer just to fluff my brick
Say what I wanna say, and I don't give a f*ck, I'm rich (ah)
Tuck my fifth, don't hesitate to bust my shit
I tell you niggas like Kyrie, ""Suck my dick"" (haha)
I don't trust a soul, I don't even trust my bitch (uh-uh)
Before I fall in love, I'd rather cut my wrist (ah)
I sweat Ace of Spades, nigga, that's how much I sip
Body a rap nigga quick before the Dutch got twist
(Ayo, let's roll somethin')
Yeah, the shotty ring, this shit is not a thing (uh-huh)
Chopper make your body lean, my niggas body things (brr)
Uh, I'm with the jackboys, I'm with the robbin' team (uh-huh)
On my mama, I never rocked a pair of Robin jeans (hahaha)
Everything I jot is mean, how you gon' stop Machine?
My name, it probably ring like Las Vegas slot machines
The MAC by my pelvis in my Helmut Lang (uh-huh)
The shells'll bang, make everything outta your helmet hang (boom boom)
Uh, the mayo jar was Hellmann's when I swirled the 'caine
Then I wrapped the yayo up in cellophane (woo)
My shooter got Dame Lillard from the elbow aim
I thought of that while I was courtside at the Melo game (ah)
Bricks are off-white, I imported some (uh-huh)
Whippin' all night until the mornin' come (all night, nigga)
Still pitchin' long nights until my fortune come
That's big checks on the side like the Off-White Jordan 1s, uh

Ayo, they think this shit a game, nigga (this shit a game, nigga)
Ayo, they think this shit a game (this shit a game) (oh word?)
Ayo, they think this shit a game
Until I pull up, let it ring, nigga (let it ring, nigga)
Until I pull up, let it ring (let it ring)
Until I pull up, let it ring
Ayo, they think this shit a game, nigga (this shit a game, nigga)
Ayo, they think this shit a game (this shit a game, huh?)
Ayo, they think this shit a game
Until I pull up, let it bang, nigga (let it bang, nigga)
Until I pull up, let it bang (let it bang) (boom, boom, boom)
Until I pull up, let it (boom)

I used to be a man of the people
Hit the clubs and mingle (what up?)
Used to dream one day I'd be fuckin' pink like a flamingo (pink)
That was back when I smoked Canibus
Man, but it was tough, 'cause I was a fan of his
So it sucked to hand him his ass, but
Yeah, lookin' back on my feuds
How me and Ja Rule almost got cool
'Cause we shot pool back in '01
Was it '02? I don't know, but
Something told me fuckin' not to
Then we got stuck in high school, I shoved an Oscar up his wazoo
Yeah, but I think of the rappers I slayed and buried like every night
And every career I might've killed, sometimes I say a prayer and I
Wonder is there a heaven for a G? And if so, is the sanctuary nice?
Studios for rap like Coolio, shootin' craps at gangster's paradise
Huh, here a mic, there a mic
Everywhere a mic, share and share alike
But just don't compare alike
Instead of comparin' me, pick a fair fight
Compare me to lightnin', that similarity's strikin'
Compare me to Jaws
Compare me to Manson, Marilyn or Charles
Compare me to Nas, Biggie, or Pac
Do not compare me to that Iggy bitch
Or all this fuckin' Milli Vanilli hip-hop
This is where all that silly shit stops
Compare me to the pistol that triggered this thought
The semi, the Glock, 9 millis get cocked, I'm sending a shot
Don't come around with them floss raps tryna stunt
Compare me to Meek, big wheelies get popped
One by one, compare 'em to scabs, I'm picking them off
They're going home to f*ck Nicki Minaj, aw
Compare me to Diggity-Das, yah
I'm hickity-hitting it raw, ha
In the trailer park (haha)
Told her I'd play the part like Kanan Stark's
Ate her twat like a Tater Tot, oh shit
Get the strap like a trainin' bra
Lunchtime like at eight-o'clock
But Shady's not for the faint of heart
Goin' at these pricks like Lorena Bobbitt
Y'all want drama, we can make a scary movie like Marlon Wayans
Y'all lookin' at the charred remains of Charlamagne tha God
Slim whip, Westside, and Conway are not playin'
I cock back, aim, and I spray you like (boom)"
544,drop the world ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/18718073/Eminem/Drop+the+World+%5BEdit%5D+%5BEdit%5D,"I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And drop it on yo fuckin' head, haha
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""F*ck 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*ck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a f*ck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce  and olives
I'll fuckin'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)"
545,rainy days,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35949169/Eminem/Rainy+Days,"Nigga, I wear fur coats in the summer, nigga
Wife beaters in the winter, damn
Uh, shit

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

Yo, yo, aw, man
Yo, word to the titles
So word to my idols and word to the goats (Uh)
I ain't sayin' I like 'em
I'd kill all them niggas and wear 'em as coats (Uh)
Word to the feelings I channel
I lose 'em as quick as a fuckin' remote (Uh)
Don't be callin' me woke (No)
I cheat on my queen for a hoe
That's how shit go, she keep sayin' we chill (Ayy)
She gon' come out her shell (Woah)
Ain't no pushin' my buttons
When all of my feelings is stuck on a wheel (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm thirsty and blessed (Ayy)
I pour liquor in grills (Woah)
This for my niggas in jail, wrestlin' L's (Uh)
That's that hell in the cell
I come from a place where the shit can get shady
My chances was slim (Ayy)
All my women was basic
We see different races since signing to him (Yeah)
I can't send out no message to none of my exes
And bitches as friends (Ayy)
I can't blow it again
Need a bitch that's as thick as my skin, shit 'cause

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away

I left my legacy hurt? Fuckin' absurd
Like a shepherd havin' sex with his sheep, f*ck what you heard
All this talk in my ear, I got a idea
Like the clerk when you tryna buy beer (ID ya)
Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare
F*ck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye
I got the bottle of NyQuil right here (Right here)
You want the sleep me to wake, you want Slim Shady EP
That's on the CD cover, sockin' my mirror (Sockin' my mirror)
I promise not to cry crocodile tears (Crocodile tears)
If you end up shocked at my lyrics (Shocked at my lyrics)
Marshall is dead in the water, but not that I care
Dre said, ""Rock the boat"" and the Doc is my pier
So, it's unanimous, you're at attention, the planet's listenin'
And their banana splits again, which has its advantages
But when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickenson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture, then ripped it in half
And whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many rounds or if I get knocked down
In a bout and fell to the ground
I got a fighter's mentality, I'll get back up and fight with it
In fact, I'ma attackin' the mic with it
I'll make it sound (Sound) like a vampire's bitin' it
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick (Sidekick)
To be down for the count (Haha), yeah
Yo, album's (What?), out (Yeah), now (Uh)
Pow (Pow), wow (Woo), I don't (Huh), see no (Uh) clouds (Nah)
But ain't gon' (No) be no (Huh) drought (Uh-uh)
Smile (No), frown (Yeah), upside (Ah) down (Ya)
Shut my (Nope) mouth (Yeah), how? (How)
That ain't what (What) I'm 'bout
Shout (Shout), showers (F*ck it, ow, ow)
Thug it out (Ow), 'cause

I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need changes in a major way (Yeah, yeah, yeah), a way (Uh)
I just hope I never, damn (I just hope I never)
I just pray I never, f*ck (I just pray I never)
I've been thuggin' through my rainy days for days (Rainy days, uh)
I ain't really tryna hang today, today (Hang today, uh)
I need changes in a major way, a way (Major way, uh)
I just pray I never fade away, away"
546,here comes the weekend ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28442774/Eminem/Here+Comes+the+Weekend+%5BExplicit+Version%5D+%5BVersion%5D,"Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren oh oh
We don't want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

I just wanna play, big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know what's better for you
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight no oh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb
About to blow oh oh

Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren oh oh
We don't look for trouble,
Just enough to seeing double

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
F*ck what they say
Let the rum flow until it rains oh oh
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight no oh oh

High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb
About to blow oh oh

Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren eh oh eh oh
We don't look for trouble,
Just enough to seeing double

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

Nothing high class in my glass
Only bottles of pop
My bottles are popped so when I pop up in the spot
I'm probably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or Ciroc
I'm not Puffy but I'ma run this city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin' idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights
Little indignity, hot diggity
This Biggie is gettin' me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you
I'll knock a dick in the dirt, bickerin' worse
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel
Hangin' from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building
'Cause we're tearin' it down, security get out
The frickin' way, Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it's loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going eeh 'cause

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh

Oh oh

Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens oh oh"
547,my life ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28401736/Eminem/My+Life+%5BEdited+Version%5D,"My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

Yeah, 03, I went from plain filthy to filthy rich
Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
'Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
Sipping on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spaghett-even?
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the buginning
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', f*ck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plu~gged in the
Motherfucking wall with three thousand volts of electrucity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers in each
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
F*ck letting up, you’re gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah, it's happening again
I'm thinking about just saying
""Mother f*ck everybody that's up in this bitch, but 50!""
'Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
'Cause I'm running in circles with

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like forty million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it three A.M. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face, and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift, God-given, like the air in the lungs
Of every fucking thing livin'

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try"
548,not afraid ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/19596189/Eminem/Not+Afraid+%5BExplicit+Version%5D,"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so f*ck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a f*ck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And f*ck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that f*ck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
549,chloraseptic,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35192616/Eminem/Chloraseptic,"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary 
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out (write it out)
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh (haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (bitch!)

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
F*ck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew"
550,remind me ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35192613/Eminem/Remind+Me+%28Intro%29,"Yeah
Damn girl
Do I drive you crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things, I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things, that I never felt
You gotta be the real thing 'cause you remind me of myself"
551,like home,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35192610/Eminem/Like+Home,"Yo, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
He's tryin' to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can’t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (yeah)

Here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home"
552,arose,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35192603/Eminem/Arose,"If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning, so definite, wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm trying to rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, f*ck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin', now I know"

For one second My name is (My name is Slim Shady)

Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a base-head!"" Uh-uh!
""So why's your face red? Man you wasted!""
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!""

Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (F*ck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh yup!) Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll f*ck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad (Argh!) And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)

I'd be a horrible mixtape DJ
I would be really fuckin bad
THIS IS MOTHERFUCKIN EMINEM!
Or just Eminem
Whatever you want to call me
And your listenin to the motherfuckin easy listenin sounds, or whatever
Clear your fuckin ear wax out
This is motherfuckin DJ Kay Slay
The Drama King and it goes a little somethin like this
Yo turn that click off, alright 

(*beat to Eminem, Obie Trice & 50 Cent's ""Love Me"" starts*)
Look ..

[Eminem]
My music is soothin but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump outta ya car while it's movin
You've been waitin on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen, I'm servin, I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book go head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage ya find somethin
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin
I'm constantly coppin over you, squatin, shit is gotten
To the point, where I'm ain't even writin no more I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickin, I've been kickin ass off bullshit, throw away rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap
You crazy? I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat
You Canibus? then it's Dre's beat
You Kay Slay? the fee's waived
I stay beefin with JD to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's ok to stop blazin him
Oops I put it out I apologize now is too late G
It's on tape and the tape leaked
""Say what you say"" motherfucker
Drama King, Kay Slay motherfucker
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker
Xzibit blaze this little gay midget cocksucker"
555,baby,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35705336/Eminem/Baby,"One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the f*ck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
F*ck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
F*ck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya"

I’m at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can’t be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it’s both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain’t

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don’t wanna share you with no one else
What the f*ck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That’s a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany’s
You better have an epiphany"

The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
""I remember it clearly, even today""
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, F*ck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey"
558,beautiful pain,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35705333/Eminem/Beautiful+Pain,"I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light"
559,'till i collapse ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/9980308/Eminem/%27Till+I+Collapse+%5BInstrumental%5D,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a f*ck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me"

[Skam]
Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear (F*ck that!)
Bustin' lyrics in the air
Keepin' some up in the chamber

[Eminem]
Yo Skam, what the f*ck you doin'?

[Skam]
Man, I'm releasin anger!

[Eminem]
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day
Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear
Keepin' some up in the chamber

[Skam]
Aiyyo Shady what the f*ck you doin'?

[Shady]
I'm releasin anger!

[Skam]
Man I'm tired of bein' tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin', and endin' up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the f*ck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin', girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like im throwin' gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposi''n the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but f*ck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the f*ck you doin?)

Chorus

[Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ""O"" that I snifed off caine
You know you're spaced the f*ck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Can't promise you a million bucks

Everybody wants a million bucks
But I'd rather have a million days with you
Day one we'd go fishing
Dollar movies on day two
Days three and four we'd spend in bed

A million days with you
Would go by much too fast

Camping on day six
Days seven and eight I'd show you how much I love you

Yeah
I'm a (boy's crazy), I'm a cold-blooded (killer)
Made all this money from doin' this (yeah, look)
(D.A. got that dope)

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drip

I used to rock a toboggan
Headphones around my neck, tryna be like Shady
Now the phone that's in my pocket seem to keep vibratin'
I got all these Ronnie Bennetts tryna be my baby
Tryna fiancé me
I take the steering wheel and drive them girls beyond crazy (crazy)
I'm on a song with my idol
I'm a cold-blooded version of the song title
I put these diamonds in the ring like they was Shawn Michaels
I can't put the Louis V inside the wash cycle
I take this shit to the cleaners
'Bout to cop me a Bimmer, I got a special demeanor
She was mine when I seen her, I'm gettin' meaner and meaner
Called the front desk and asked for a steamer
I'm a bitch bagger, not a Twitch streamer
I'm eatin' pizza in Little Italy, damn, I used to hit Caesars
She 'bout to finish, but wait a minute, it gets deeper
Same kid just a bit sleeker

Yeah, now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it

Listen, uh
They say my killing's horrendous, ""How he still in the business?""
Rich as hell and it's feelin' tremendous
Ma dukes chillin' in Venice, compliments of her eldest, the cynic
Give hell with these writtens, this shit only propel my ascension
I held my position in any situation that's needed
This year I'm shittin' on niggas for the way we was treated
I see the impact of all my creations increasin'
My step in time with these Pantheons, it all was divine
I'm in this moment of my life where shit is fallin' in line
And lookin' back, I swear to God, you'd think it all was designed
A true movie script, I can't really ever f*ck no groupie bitch
All she got is diamonds on her mind on some Uzi shit
A whole generation of geniuses I'm influencin'
I only hang with real niggas who I'm congruent with
I manifest nothing less than the best outcome
Just watch my moves with this next album, nigga

Now count it, five, ten, yeah, fifteen, twenty
Twenty-five, thirty, yeah, get the money
Throw it in the furnace, yeah, this shit be funny
Earn it just to burn it, swag drippin' from me

My sentences are harsh, every single's bar's like a verdict
I say it with conviction, but this time you're not gonna serve it
But as soon as I read it, you know that you're about to get murdered
When I cap, it'll punish, then put you in a box like a juror (haha)
If there's a rapper I haven't ate (where?)
We ain't battled, either that or they won't collaborate
'Cause pad or paper freestyle will settle that debate (yup)
I call it guillotine style 'cause even off the head, I decapitate
Yeah, bitch, I go harder than Carter III (what?)
But I think your thottie just thought of me
She got a body and bottom like Cardi B
And she be stalking me like I was broccoli
I'm getting brain now like a lobotomy
You probably thinkin' you had that shit in the bag like it's colostomy (what?)
It's a red alert, you better skrrt or try to get on my level first
Bitch, I'd had to shovel dirt and dig a hole to get on yours
You bum-bum (haha), look at your broke ass (yeah)
It's why you're a bum-bum (why?) 'cause your shit is so ass (yeah)
Syllable gun-guns (chk-chk), spits and goes ""Hadoo"" (doo)
Only L that I ever took was when I lost Proof (yeah)
Only time that I ever got served is that lawsuit when Ma sued (what?)
But, bitch, get out of pocket and I might accost you (accost you)
Homicides up the wazoo
(Chain) chain gaudy, probably got more bodi-odi-odies than John do (John do)
I just called Snoop and I talked to him (What?), we all cool (yeah)
Dre, me and the Dogg good, Doc, we got you
Got a castle with a solid gold floor (what?)
No I don't, I don't even got a boat nor
Do I got a chauffeur, but a lot to show for
You don't wanna f*ck around and start no war (nah)
Twenty more years, I could probably go for
Just like your lip and you got a cold sore
My shit is like motherfuckin' herpes
You ain't ever gonna say I don't got it no more (bitch)
Literally it's no quittin' me, you kiddin' me?
Dyin' laughin' is the only way you're killin' me
I'm gettin' rid of ya, get clapped like chlamydia
The wittiest, bitch, I'll snap like a tibia
You wanna get silly with the bars? I'm frivolous
But I'm as gritty and litty as my city is
East side 'til I die, bitch, I will rep 'til the end like a chameleon
Got a killer instinct with the pen's ink and they're in sync like a faucet
How the f*ck do I even think of this ridiculous shit?
I'm a quarter of a century deep and I can't be beat (nah)
'Til the day me and the Grim Reap meet, I'm ten toes down 'til I'm six feet deep (what?)
Windows down in the Benz E Jeep, hollerin' at a bimbo, beep-beep-beep
She said she fucks with the M-T-B to the M-B: Side B Slim CD
I can see why you envy me, you get no ass like an empty seat (haha)
So this shit comes with a warning for all you punks and you corny
Little fucks, I woke up on my f*ck shit this morning

This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
Oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided
to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the
baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls
""Like I'm just checking on you dog""
While I throw up this message on the star

I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass

And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
Shit, the day that I dont straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
Without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
Cause I'll be screaming on these horns till I'm hoarse!

With AK's with baby bayonet's
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
Thats why its either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homocide Ryan

I'ma live wire, I am on the edge
Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
Get on a nut like a tyre iron

Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flying by 'em

Ha ha ha
Riding around in one of Dre's Farrari's n****
Or matter a fact I might be in Detroit
Riding down 8 Mile road
You know, for one of them en-joints and s***
Ha-ha
Ya heard, I got place to go man
You know, Shady Aftermath
We finished our print money
Puttin' our faces on this motherf***in bill thug s***
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ain't seem to be doing much"

Dad, what?
What'd I fuckin' tell you about turnin' off the lights? (What, what? I didn't do it)
Don't fuckin' lie to me, I told you fuckin' don't touch, turn the fuckin' lights off
(I didn't do it)
Don't you fuckin' lie, you little fucker (no)
Don't you fuckin' lie to me (stop)"
569,favorite bitch,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893628/Eminem/Favorite+Bitch,"Nah, for real, know what I'm sayin', like
Like music's my first love, right
But, what it turned into is like
You know these-these cats got it now, she just like a ho
They ain't doin' it right to make
Yeah, for real, yeah, yeah
Switched it up, don' changed the shit on that damn
Yeah, everybody don' ran through it
Mumble rappin'
Ain't no more substance in shit
Right, right
(They don't treat it how it needs to be treated)
I kinda want that old thing back

Yeah, I was young, I was hungry
I was chasing the bag at twenty-one
I was lucky to find an uneaten fuckin' (what?)
Honeybun I forgot about
Now I got money falling out, fifties, hundreds, and twenties (right)
And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing
But we got something in common, both of us are alarmin' (what?)
Foul, disgusting, and awful (yeah), so repugnant and ugly (yup)
I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah
And you could say I'm a little bit immature
But this type of literature got me a little richer, haha
But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
You're letting him fiddle with your clitoris
Remember you were my fuckin'

You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things will never be the same
Ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script
You done let a bunch of lames fall through
And complain that I can't burn it
You ain't have to do it like that
Told you I'd be right back
Look at what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music I had to bounce on my favorite bitch

Yeah, always hated my smile
Mama told me it's goofy
I'd get picked on at school
Come home and she'd school me
She never sugarcoated it to me
She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly
I wouldn't always get bullied (true)
I think of my struggles and get emotional
Could be 'cause how behind the 8-ball
And far in the hole that they put me
Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (yeah)
I'm just trollin' you pussies
But I'm like stroller 'cause you'll see just how I roll if you push me (haha)

But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times I drew from her
But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her
'Cause the thought of losing her
Makes me just wanna just let loose on her
When I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her

Tell her, it's a butt-dial girl, yeah, booty-call (haha)
That's how it used to be
'Cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (Fifty)
F*ck, I miss them days

You used to be my favorite, bitch
Things will never be the same
Ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script
You done let a bunch of lames fall through
And complain that I can't burn it
You ain't have to do it like that
Told you I'd be right back
Look at what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music I had to bounce on my favorite bitch

You fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?
I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
I swear to God, you run to that door
I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head
Now I'ma ask you this one time
And the answer better be, ""Yes""

Would you marry me again?
Now that everything is changed (yeah)
It'll never be the same (ah)
As the era whence we came (who?)
From Nas to Pac, Rock (yeah), Eric B, and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo MTV Raps (yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode
The feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape
You hold and peel it back, yeah
Tear it off then play it (what?)
Swear to God, 4 o'clock
We crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks
When Nani was con-artisted (yeah)
And Proof had his hair in locks (doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearing clocks
Back with Ed Lover (yes)
And there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (pair of docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't don't wanna (yeah), stop 'til I get you back
'Cause I got put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
The other part wants to tell you to just get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped you're mind
You must be buying your time looking for someone to come along
That'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully it was never really you and me
Exclusively it is too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through
Bet they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can
Hear me? I used to be your favorite, bitch"

Call it toilet paper, yeah, flushed with cash
Girl, nice butt, is it up for grabs?
Just wanna touch your ass, is that too much to ask? Yeah
I made it grip, I know it's tough to grasp, get the bag
Call it potato chips, I stuff in duffel bags
In some public transportation shit, 'cause I will bust your ass

As for me, I'm the Kim Jong-Un, a pimp, son
Swag dripping, I'm in a pub
Went up to this chick, who was so tipsy, we went to hug
Ended up tripping, I picked her up
She yelled out it's her birthday
She's fifty and in the club
Then it comes on (yeah), that ""In da Club"" song (yah)

And I'm cocking rap, some on your head
Other words, I'm stocking caps and I'm talking facts
Like OfficeMax
Never down, I'll be up like an insomniac
Girl, I got racks you gotta rack
How you got all that back and no body fat
I'm in awe with that
When I stop the Pontiac at the laundry mat that I saw you at
You almost had a heart attack, went into Cardiac
You ran inside, told your boyfriend like, ""I'll be back""
But for all you know I probably act like I'm Daniel Wozniak
I'm a psycho-pa-pathic killer
I'm a cap peeler, caterpillar
With the botanic of bananas you never heard better vernacular comin' after your scapular
For the lack of a better word Dracula
'Cause I'm attackin' a rapper at the phrenic nerve
I'm a savage, back to put the dagger in the back of competitors
Predator and scavenger
I am a carnivore and a baller, you're at the dollar store
What the f*ck you got a wallet for? Y'all are poor

The ultimate
I just let the poker chips fall but they were supposed to fit
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Tryna save at Kroger (yeah)
So why would I give a f*ck about backstabbin' Trader Joe for?

You want smoke, I got the Tical like Method Man
So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (yo)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (yeah)
A mic in my hand's a weapon (what?)
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
Too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella man
What I am is better than
Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together
And I put the game on the pill (yeah)
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
You 'bout to experience euphoria

Give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause boy I

A stay of execution
No more distribution (the f*ck you doin'?)

Now you gotta suffer the consequences
Pack up the pack and swing it for the fences (just remember that)

Let's make one thing clear (here)
Here, my dear, my resolute for this year
No pollution, fresh air
My solution, long hair with a fat ass, I'm deadass
Mile high club 'til I jetlag

Single negro, I don't need your double standards and hypocrisy
And that fake hand holding on Father's Day
You a different motherfucker when you not with me
Been sleepin' with the enemy, mockery
It's like I'm John F. Kennedy, shots at me
Yes, I'm President of Debauchery
None of that bullshit ever got to me
'Cause your pillow, Brillo, ditto
Breakin' this shit down little by little
I ain't got time for the fuckin' pom-poms
Shoulda never let this dog out of that kennel

To the doctor, these are wounds you cannot nurse
Hope it's drivin' you bonkers that I'm not yours (Oh no)

Just 'cause you can makeup an on the spot lie
I'm comin' out, guns blazin', shots fired
Hand sani', I ain't cuttin' off ties

Guess it's back to the trailer and pot pies
Hope I pull up to the window at Popeyes
One day and you'll be servin' me hot fries (you did this to me)

Off of your knees (yeah), beggin' for forgiveness

573,stepdad,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37920450/Eminem/Stepdad,"Ayo
This a song about
My, my stepdad
Let's see if this ever happened to you
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures that I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I cried
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I just wish I could jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection and put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion
Then mom and him let bygones, just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this why I

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry, which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes ""Whoops"" and just laughs
I yelled for mom (mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""F*ck you punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter wein
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)"
574,don't front,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30159817/Eminem/Don%27t+Front,"Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the the Doc replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
'Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the ""dope,"" so when names come up
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere, where it fires and I unload my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause they were new
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
'Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo why you frontin', you know I got you open, kid

Rest in piece to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like I'm in the zone
I'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
From beef, beep-beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as f*ck, but can't even say bon appetit
'Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, homes, your mind's blown
'Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed, up in the Ebony Showcase
With Denaun screaming ""Who the f*ck passed you the mic?""
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
'Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the f*ck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
'Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo why you frontin', you know I got you open, kid

Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight
'Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke was so long ago, I lost my concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's this good with the fucking mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
You know I got you open, Word Life"
575,you gon' learn,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36789032/Eminem/You+Gon%27+Learn,"Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' off of coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
(Deal with life)
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talkin' reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged
Ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (yeah)
Was a have-not (yeah) 'cause my pockets (uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get colder, began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the Doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""F*ck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' f*ck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare

Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn"
576,she loves me,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37920466/Eminem/She+Loves+Me,"She loves me, she loves my knot
Not for who I am, but what I got, yeah
And, I don't wanna blow up her spot
But da-na-na-na-na-da-na (woo)
Lady, I've been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
Hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (yeah)
Been checkin' you out ever since the second you stepped in through Nani's dressing room
Girl, you're stunning, I'd bet that you'd zap me if I was next to you
Sparks'll fly, I expect them too
I'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're Carmen Electrocute (cutie)
And those ain't just sound effects, I knew something was special as soon as we swapped info
I knew that

She loves me, she loves me not
For who I am, but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
She loves me (one more time)
I said 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me

Sorry I missed your call again, I be in the studio usually
But tomorrow afternoon for me, it'd work beautifully
If your schedule's open, you say, ""That's cool with me
But you stood me up twice, Slim, you're 0-for-2 with me""
'Cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
Well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
Yeah, I'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the D
And soon as we hung up, I'm like, ""Woo""

'Cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
She loves me (ayy yo, lemme do this bridge right quick)

She pulls me close and whispers to me, oh
Lies in my ear, but that's all I wanna hear
It's okay long as we both know this is all it is, whoa
She can have my love for as long as we both are here

Back in my spot now
The music is loud, so I turn the boombox down
We cut off our cell phones
You're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like Balboa
'Cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (whoo)
I put the moves on you like a U-Haul
Bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall to the floor
But canoodlin', I'm not in the mood for
Gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna spoon, doll
But before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
We can f*ck in the closet or in my elevator (uh)
And maybe when it stops and the door opens, we fall out and we just get off on this floor (haha)
You say you're falling for me but not 'cause I'm famous
Then explain to me who that tattoo that's your leg's of?
Girl, your game is an A-plus but you think I don't notice who the screensaver on your damn phone is?
It ain't 'cause who I am, bullshit
I like you, just don't take me for no stupid ass
No disrespect, 'cause even though you're like my truest fan
Know it's clear you only love me 'cause I'm Superman, Lois
But f*ck it

'Cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me (one more time)
I said 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
For who I am (she loves me), but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
She loves me

She loves my knot, haha
I'm just playin', I ain't got no foosball table"

And I still ain't been to bed (bed, bed)
And while you got your eyes closed
The devil wakes up in my (head, head)
He told me that you hate me
And you blame me
And you said that you wish that you were dead
So I write a little note out
Suicidal love roulette

You make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
I'd rather a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
Just like a fool
Just like a fool

I walk up to the edge, yeah
And say a prayer before I let go (let go, let go)
I'll probably see you through the window
While I'm falling past the fifth floor (fifth floor, fifth floor)
Then you get there just in time
To save me and apologize
And maybe we can go back to bed
But you run past me instead
And hit the ground before I can

I had to watch you
Jump off the roof
Boy, I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
Just like a fool

Maybe Buddha's got it right
We reincarnate every time
And I'll find you in another life
Maybe Buddha's got it right
We reincarnate every time
And I'll find you in another life

I don't really wanna fight (nah)
I just wanna spend the night (yeah)
But I don't wanna spend the night
Actin' out, ""Love the way you lie""
But this shit just went awry
Hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry
I'm at the end of my wits
Let's end this, ma (it's over)
Then begin again tomorrow
Fresh start, let you spoil me
Pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king 
Just to (royalty), f*ck me over royally
Boy, are we water mixed with oil
See another shouting match
'Bout to have it out
But no matter how, mad I get
I'm so mad about you
Forgot what I was even mad about ('bout)
I know we've had our challenges still (still)
I keep trying to salvage it you (you)
Wanna sabotage it, I'm down to the hill
But you think I'm fucking around on you, chill (chill)
It never changes, I doubt if it will (will)
Cheat on me then say how does it feel? (feel)
I feel like blowing my fucking head off
After I write you out of my will (will)
Bitch how could you? (huh?)
Almost had a child with you
Would've settled down with you
Now put you in the ground and bury myself with you
I don't get you, it's as if you're drowning
I stick my hand out, but you fool me
You're just trying to pull me down with you (down with you)
Thought it was you my world revolve around ('round)
I should aim a revolver round at you (at you)
180 proof, as I'm making my way to the roof (roof)
You're a traitor I say that we're through (through)
You hop in the elevator then you
Say the coffin they better make it for two (two)
'Cause if you jump I'm jumpin' with you (you)
And neither one of us have nothin' to lose
But each other we're just a couple of fools

'Cause you make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool

You make me wanna
Jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death
Just like a fool
We'll need a coffin
Hand made for two
'Cause I love you to death

578,higher,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893625/Eminem/Higher,"Yeah
You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah, I do, haha

I look at me now I'm thinkin, ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They hollerin', ""Shady""
Yellin' it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get a chance to get a crowd
I'll flip it around and have a crowd give me the chance
I've done it all, man
But in actuality I haven't, yet

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch but I was grateful to trade that shit for the trailer with the hitch
Thought it would made me a ravin' lunatic
But I made it through to my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
Now I'm just paradin', you would still get Shady 'til I'm eighty two
I spit this crazy, even Dre he knows I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (my only question is)
(I know I talk about this shit a lot but)
Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flop, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on their grind, makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you water down
You gotta take shots with 100 proof

Check that
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have the savage within
Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an MC
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti
Would be like remedial readin' to me (yeah)
'Til my last breath leave my lungs, I'ma beat my drums (yeah)
For the streets I'm from (yeah)
The east side slums (yeah)
Gotta remind 'em (yeah)
I take a foe out (yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (what), you see my thumb (what?)
You see my fist, f*ck a peach pipe bum (what?)
For the smoke but it's not the weed I want (what?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I come (woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm off kickin' feet in the recliner
And I think I'm up
'Bout to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been
(For the last time, man)
Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been"

Y'all ain't dealing with the same boy (no)

New attitude mixed with that pure raw (uh)
The night game, your girl called
She like, ""Do me, baby, down to get busy, busy?"" (Yes)
No dice, chill, whoadie (no)
In life, feeling dizzy
Oh, having visions of the city and I go to war
See me in the day through the late night (night)

To the gods, can't stop a hero when he in flight (flight)
I'm swimming in the light right
Go and get you some, go and show 'em something, this a new thang

Can't stunt a nigga growth, better get gone, move along (uh)
You don't wanna trip, wanna get it on (uh)
You don't wanna act, don't get me wrong (nah)
They don't listen to the words in the song (uh-huh)
We ain't gotta tell 'em, we just getting ready (yeah)
See 'em fronting, we ain't kidding
If you want it, you can get it
Members of the rage, come and get you some
Next step's out the jet from the lean back (ow)
Running 'round the world and we ain't packed
Hit 'em, vroom, vroom, leave 'em stuck, oh, you seen that? (ow)
I'm chillin' where the team at
See a black Benz pull up with some jawns, yeah, I need that
So crazy, can't believe it
No cams, damn, no filming at all, real nigga facts (come on)
Years ago, rehab
All good, helped me figure out another plan
It got bad, so bad
Nah, I ain't fucking love that, man
Then I hopped out in a new zone with my Louis bag
True story, take you through the dark and the light (yeah)
Godson, got through new
Back up in the world, it's the day in the life (Cud)
Hit the blunt and get it (dude)
Raised bars (uh), same song, we did it (yeah)
Hot sauce, pour it on all jams, explicit
Carry on, smoke strong, got your mama down with it (come on)
And the game fuckin' needed something dirty raw
Tell them this the law and we weeded, uh (yeah)

So if it's God you believe in (yeah)
Bob your head and just nod in agreement (yeah)
They say time's undefeated
I'ma be the first one who can beat it (yeah)
I had hoop dreams (yup), now I shoot threes (what?)
Got a lil' green (yeah), but I don't do weed (nope)

Snoop D-O-double (uh), that's two G's (yup)
I probably spent on paper, ooh-wee
Since Tuesday, probably killed a few trees (yeah)
But the only ones I smoke are the loose leaf
Not high, but I'm your highness (what?)
And secretly, you're my dick (ha)
But you haters are butthurt (ow), bunch of sore hind-ends (ow)
I was just a poor white kid (yeah)
Now if rap was B-ball, I'd be Jordan-like, bitch (what?)
You wish you could score like this (nah), yeah
Not even at half court, I'd miss (nah)
I'm mouthwash, 'cause if I was on the floor, I'd swish (fluoride, fluoride, swish)
But I cannot lie (nah) I got you in my top five
Worst rappers of all time (ha, ha)
I lost my spot, y'all got Alzheim' (uh)
King of rap? Nah, their words, not mine (yeah)
King of swear words and not lying (yeah)
You should never compare yours (nope)
A toll-free number (yeah), only way you'll ever have a hot line
F*ck's going on, man? (Yeah)
Bunch of half-wits up in office (what?)
Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse
Other half are just pissed off and (yeah)
Don't wanna wear a mask and they're just scoffing
And that's how you end up catching the shit off 'em
I just used the same basket as you shopping
Now I'm in a fuckin' casket from you coughin' (damn)
Always stay ahead of haters, let 'em hate
But never let a traitor penetrate your circle
Separate yourself from those who try to pull you down
The real ones never stray, it's sort of like Medusa (yeah)
That's how you stay ahead of snakes (woo)
Emcees pull out gats, I don't give a f*ck how strapped
You're gonna out-rap me? I doubt that
Please, bitch, I'm a house rat
These raps are 'bout that cheese like mousetraps
Earthlings, I adapt to 'em
Certain things, I don't want to do, but have to in
Order to just act human
Like using a bathroom and vacuuming (yeah)
Rapping in the booth in a triple fat goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music (nah)
Running through ink like I'm tattooing (yeah)
This is music to be murdered by, you love
Turn the volume up, I am fired up like a blunt
Bread is long like an Italian sub, I am drugs
That is probably why your opinion of me's high as f*ck
And it's nonstop fury (yeah)
'Cause I ain't holding 'em up like an armed robbery (nah)
And God's my jury, so when I die, I'm not worried (nah)
Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery (yeah)
How the f*ck is it that so many cops are dirty? (Huh?)
Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry
But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me
Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery (f*ck)

The adventures of Moon Man and Slim (ah)
Yes, who want it with them?
The trilogy continues
Serving niggas, yes, see what's on the menu (yeah)

I was here, so were you, you came and went, I stuck around (yeah)
Still here now, stop me how?
Your opinion's like a broken calculator, that shit doesn't count
Shut your motherfucking mouth

I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said, I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad (yeah), every thought that I had

Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, I'm in my bag
I get a little testy when I'm mad, sick of wrestlin' this iPad
Unsuccessfully I might add, and I know it's best to leave it live
But even I get obsessed with readin' everything
And let it get the best of me 'til I snap
But I need to get off the internet (get off the internet)
I need to get on the mic (get on the mic)
You need to get off the internet (internet), you need to get you a life
Why you waste time just to comment on shit? (Comment on shit)
'Specially shit you don't like (shit you don't like)
Don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me about your favorite rapper 
If it's some shit he didn't write
What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen
He used to rap like the people his music was for
He was exactly like them
The dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?
Can't use that excuse anymore
He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war
With a clown he's yelling ""At it again""
I talk to your mother, she told me she love me
All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me
Wants nobody but me, she showed me the duggy
Can I get a witness like notary public?
She said kicks some fly shit (fly shit)
I said I got wings on my ass (wings on my ass)
Told her my dick's a cockpit (dick's a cockpit)
I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)
Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded
This Instru's mental, too many bars, incidental charges
When did it start? I been cold hearted in this heart
Since kindergarten, mental sharpness
Which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'
Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (meal's gonna come from)
Now I just wonder (now I just wonder) where my next mil's gonna come from
I cannot have no success, unless when I finally make it
I get to remind all the haters, who shitted on me when I'm on my way up
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
I will swear on a stack of Bibles
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols
I don't care, it's Music To Be Murdered By
So Bon Iver can swallow a fucking Ja Rule bobblehead
Then die slow like Alzheimer's (haha)
Low sniper, I hold the micro-phone like a loaded rifle
My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull is fire
All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires
And y'all are a flow biters, so I don't gotta explain why they call me your ghostwriter

I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said, I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad (yeah), every thought that I had (Illa)

Haven't used all the tricks I had, so like my balls, it's in my bag
I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad
But gift of gab and pen to pad
Turn temper tantrums into anthems
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks
Spit your damnedest, you're still gonna hit the canvas
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
Then the amygdala hippocampus
Is gonna trigger the ingoramus
To think of the most ridiculous shit then spit
Then pin it against these pitiful rappers
Insidious, these idiots witty as shit, against me, shitty as MC Hammers
Get your whole squad, send the task force in
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for
Then put your helmet on, strap your chin
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
Or to go against, f*ck would you wanna do that for?
No offense, but are you retard, slow or dense?
A fuckin' penny has more sense
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal
But every thought is so ill and so methodical
Thought I swallowed a pill, I'm startin' to feel like I'm an automobile
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snotty articles
And that explains why the f*ck you clowns are all in my grill
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame
Choice I made, swore someday
The world'll pay, less to lose, more to gain
Daughter's raised, yesterday, glory days, adored and praised
Ignore the hate, address the fake
Toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came
Destroyed the game, before you came, enjoy your stay
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim
That you're gonna point and aim
If you joined a gang, your shit isn't goin' to bang
You're just boring, lame and more the same
You have an enormous chain, but a storm-less brain
The most you could form is rain
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
So, bitch, quit lyin', your denyin' like Mr Porter's name
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter
Fire motor, rounds I told to every iota or I load up
I owe to my motor, mouth
This is my note to self
Sometimes you're gonna bomb
So you might just have to blow yourself up with no one's help
I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
Premo, take us out

Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside"

Atop the Empire State Buildin', this shit is like child's play, children
I will not annihilate, kill them, I'll f*ck around and pile eight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then, I'll await my trial date 'til then
Ain't nothin' you say can ever Trump (Nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw and rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or naw? (Naw)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough

They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (damn)
Then it goes from Martian to human (yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat (yeah, yeah)

And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (what), that's social distancing (yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the f*ck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end? Like Monroe, Norma Jean
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope), for some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (whoa)
I got a contact like eyewear
Whoa, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea
F*ck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the f*ck off
I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfuckin' ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (damn)
Then it goes from Martian to human (yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat (fight off a gnat)"
582,these demons,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893624/Eminem/These+Demons,"Yeah, you know what? (LoudPack)
Haters are funny, man (haha)
It's like, you're gonna hate it no matter what it is
Yet you still click on it, huh, yeah (Zombie on the track)

I want you to change, but don't change (yeah)
I want you to grow up, but don't age
I want the rage, but don't get too angry
I want the new, but old Shady
I want you to say what they won't say (yeah)
Just don't go too far, but go cray
I want you to almost lose it, man
It keep movin' the goal post, don't they?
So let's cut to the chase, like OJ
In his Bronco goin' up the roadway (skrr)
And get off my dick
If I said my balls were yarn, you bitches would crochet
All I ever wanted's a rope chain
From the day I saw Cool J on Soul Train
Now I got that, Kangol 2k
Was one yellow and white gold plated
Just to let 'em know I made it

I told my dawgs we gon' get right in they ear, yeah
Wouldn't call, now dip, gone in the Lear, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down, yeah, yeah

This pandemic got us in a recession
We need to reopen America (what)
Black people dyin', they want equal rights
White people wanna get hair cuts (haha)
Some people protest, some people riot (what)
But we ain't never escapin' this virus (nah)
To the cops that are racially biased (what)
We no longer enable these liars
You get 'em on tape, they stick to a story, like Spider-Man crawin' up side of a wall and
Some are just as unabiding as lawmen (yeah)
Like Garrett Rolfe and like Derek Chauvin (yeah)
No cap, still riding with Colin
Though some people don't like me at all and (yeah)
Some are like bees to flowers (why)
'Cause some people find me appalling (haha)
Ooh, I say a line, people are outraged (oh no)
The press slams me again (yeah), the people aren't having it nowadays
Give an album that I put out in like 2000 you griped about praise
But I wake up everyday even more caked up than the makeup on your clown face
And I lay my foundation

I told my dawgs we gon' get right in they ear, yeah
Wouldn't call, now dip, gone in the Lear, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah
I ain't never comin' down, yeah, yeah

I got a question (what)
What rhymes with Pariah? (I don't know)
Mm, uh, LEGO? (Oh shit)
You just bit into the lit end of the wick
Shit, I meant, shit end of the stick
I'm addicted to friction and mischief
It's like your bitch's midriff, shit gets my dick stiff as a stickshift
Dick as in Cheney, drip as in saline
They bring my name up just to get ratings
It's like trying to choose between Bizzy, Layzie, and Wish against Krayzie
'Cause I got a bone to pick and Slim Shady (Shady)
With Thug (Thug) and Harmony (yeah)
Who attempt to diss Hailie (Hailie)
Bitch, I will go in like it's raining
And I get cancelled like once a day (yeah)
Why would I go? It's more fun to stay (ah)
You get me to leave, there's no fuckin' way
I got a better chance of fuckin' Young M.A. (ooh)
Ooh, sounds like I'm zoning
So me sayin' I'm out, nice to know me
It's like askin' me where my shin is
It's down right below knee (haha)
Uh, oh, well we can play hide the salami (yeah)
If your gal would like to blow me (yeah)
My wave is like a tsunami (yeah)
These flows you're still tryna rap your head around like you're a swami (ha)
Just call me the mic kamikaze with Mike Zombie and I'ma just keep bombing (woo)
'Cause the game is mine, like an IED (yeah)
If they ever do cancel me like Live PD
I said I'm takin' some of you with me if I'm leaving (brr)
It's time to murder you now, sike, leave me
I might knee deep to the fuckin' ice, Z, Z
Rappin' circle around these ho's
Just like gurgles and every word from my mouth so fire
I should be burnt to the ground
There's a fuckin' circus in town, yeah bitch, this verse finna clown ICP
R. Kelly sex tape, I see pee (whoa)
My shit is intense, like tipis
You gettin' wiped, like TP
You don't like me? You can bite my little white wee-wee
And I repeat, you can bite my little white wee-wee long as I like it-it
And ever since my pre-teens, striped Lee jeans and grandma Nan's little black and white TV (yeah)
Now I'm so bougie that I stick out my pinkie every time I drink tea
Used to want a wife, sweet tea (sweet tea)
Used to rock wife beaters, now I let your wife beat me (yeah)
So you can eat shit, but I might be the shit
So when I say ""Eat shit,"" I mean me"
583,alfred's theme,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893631/Eminem/Alfred%27s+Theme,"Before I check the mic (check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (yeah) give zero fucks, then I (yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then I (yeah)
Check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising every time I drop
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do, it's see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like snores, but odds like that with these thoughts I have's
Like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands

Shit, hold on, man
Motherfucker
Happy birthday to
F*ck (shh, quiet)

I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

What the f*ck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

So until the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (yeah), D.R.E and me (yup)
From the MMLP to MTBMB (bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (haha)
So call me Santa Clause (Santa Clause)
'Cause at the present (yeah), I out-rap 'em all, I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (uh)
Through a plastic straw (yeah) with a fractured jaw (damn)
My dick is coat check (ha), she wanna jack it off (yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car, get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the f*ck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (damn)
And this the final chapter, 'cause I'm either frying after
Or they gon' give me the needle (what) like a vinyl scratcher
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite like a tree mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (bark, bark, bar king)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (why) ball hard (ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bar's were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (nah)
So you'd be a fitted (yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee on your head, like a Phillies hat (haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you'd probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna f*ck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all'll get cut the f*ck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole

Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
F*ck it"
584,tone deaf,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37893630/Eminem/Tone+Deaf,"Yeah, I'm sorry (huh?)
What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (out, haha)
(I need Auto-Tune)
Yeah

It's my alter-ego's fault, these evil thoughts can be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat those off to Rico Suave, look it up
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel
A backpack full of Paxil
A black satchel, a nap sack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels
Girl, let's go back, back to my castle (yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (oh)
You, wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (what?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and X do (What the f*ck?)
'Cause who the f*ck am I laying next to? (Eh)
But ever since D-Nice ""To tha Rescue""
Feel a fresh crew (uh), been a lab rat (yeah)
From a test tube (uh), I'm goin' in like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watching your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race, stuck in saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is, I'm drivin' 'em all crazy

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (yeah, yeah)

I see the rap game then attack the verses (uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (what?)
Pockets on stuffed like a taxidermist (woo)
Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan
Colored van pulled up with a hand full of Xans
And a substantial amount of ganja, just to ask what my
Plans for the night are (yeah)
I said sneakin' to the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five star
Yeah, or leap into the deep end of the pool, I can show you where the dives are
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live, but I'm tryna get some head first, like a nose dive (haha)
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
Pushed her out the side, kicked, then I flipped
The lil' white bitch off like a light switch (bitch)
It's okay not to like my shit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch
But ask me, will I stick to my guns like adhesive tape?
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats the cheesecake and the decent steak?
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Haha)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that shit for the damn library (shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah) Well, I am piss piss off'ed-eson (oh)
Paul's askin' for Christmas off again
I said, ""No,"" then I spit this song for him, it goes

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Bitch, I can make an orange rhyme with banana, oranana
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma
But I'm more like I'm 4'5"" with the grammar
Bitch, 'bout to show you why your five favorite rappers, can't touch this
But before I get the hammer, I should warn you I'm Thor-like in this manner
But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or
I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me
I'd need to be a motherfuckin' pizzeria, but you ain't gettin' no cheese from me
I went from Lil' Ceasers, BLT-ses, grilled cheeses
Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch
Like a realtor, it's realty, bitch (real talk)
Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit
We put out fire, Dre stamps it
With my cohorts, hit up Bogart
Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', ""Oh, God""
Here comes Marshall, with no holds barred
Bitch, I'm a hurricane, you're a blow hard
Like your old broad, she full of semen, like the coast guard
And life's been pretty good to me so far, for the most part
Had a couple of run-in's with popo, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors like crowbars
Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so bitch, don't start
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart
I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw
'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw
And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' Colt cocked
My enemies I'm a chimney give me the smoke, opps
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
What the f*ck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter-ego's fault
But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob'
I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (I'm tone deaf)"

Bitch, you lost me (yeah)
Fair weather, wishy-washy
She thinks Machine washed me (what?)
Swear to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd crossed me (yeah)
I love conflict, got a obnoxious (what?) subconscious (yeah)
I'm afraid to unlock it (nah)
Keep those monsters in the closet
I'm what an idiotic ('otic) savant is (savant is)
But I've been throwin' down gauntlets since that underground ruckus (yeah)
Where I planted my roots (what, yeah)
That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (nah)
So imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak
As in Trotter, I keep slaughterin' beats
Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus
But, me, long as I re-promise to be honest
And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri
It wasn't meant to cause you grief
Regardless, it was wrong of me, but

I be on my own (yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the G.O.A.T."", I come down like, ""Ooh""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you

Yeah, they woke a giant up
So, when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the
F*ck is my head in the clouds (nah)
G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head in the clouds (haha)
Mile-high club (why), I give a flying f*ck (no)
Punchline, I'm just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas (bitch)
Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima
Syrup, I'm a shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a
Dozen, said I couldn't do it
Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (ugh)
Like a stirrup (stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (yeah)
Now, I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (haha)

I be on my own (yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the G.O.A.T."", I come down like, ""Ooh""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around

I've seen them come and go
I've seen the hugest (hugest) debuts ('buts)
I've had a great view to see the (see the) game through (through)
And, Drake, they're gonna turn on you (you) one day too (too)
And the more you win, the sooner (sooner) they do
They'll be calling you a trash bin
Sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
Even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
They ain't never comin' back in
They did it to Chance
Next they'll be mentionin' Future in the past tense (yeah)
Or sayin' ""Adios"" to Migos
I ain't dissin', I'm just tryna keep this shit a C-note (yeah)
Same people been tryna do this shit to me, so
I call them peephole
Because they're so easy to see through 'em (see through 'em)
But a fighter's all I knew how to be
I got the shit beat out of me (yeah)
Tripped and fell and blew out a knee (pop)
Popped it back in and hopped up like, ""F*ck it (f*ck it)
Best two out of three"", yeah
Man, I gotta be doin' (what) somethin' right
I got eleven years of sobriety (yeah)
So, the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me
How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
I'm diplomatic 'cause I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, dog, you was like a (yeah) damn God to me
Man, not really (haha)
I had ""dog"" backwards
But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me
Shit, it's no wonder

I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the G.O.A.T."", I come down like, ""Ooh""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you"
586,friday night cypher,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37505016/Eminem/Friday+Night+Cypher,"Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(Hit-Boy)
Ayy, this that Clipse sample, ayy (G.Ry got me)
F*ck that talking, let the clip slam 'em
Yellow bands around them hundreds, you know how much that is
Too much to give me cash, they had to wire me the back end
Niggas in here looking tough, you know that I got Mag in
Ask me am I only rapping, you know I got that bag in
Band man like Lonnie, want my head, come find me
Lil' bro in that bitch chilling he ain't tryna come home cocky
He comin' home to a dollar and a mansion and a choppa
And a desert on a dirt bike, VLONE shirt and the Pradas
Big nigga fresher than you, f*ck you and your stylist
Paid 90 for my grill and lost it, that's why I ain't smiling
You got Sean, you got Hit, you got Grizz, Kash Dolla
Paint you red, throw you in the water
They gonna think you a lobster, nigga

Uh
I just dropped a kit, you dropped out of school
These hoes wanna be famous 'til they make the news
All my bitches winning, how it feel to lose?
Nigga tryna get the box like he finna move
Bitch, I'm at my pinnacle I used to shop at Pinnacle, your nigga still drink Pinnacle
Bitch, your taste is pitiful
I talk cash shit, you ain't cash shit, call up Baby Choppa, Cash Kidd, and spend my cash, kid
You stay back like ad libs, I buy, I don't ask shit, I pop shit and pop tags, bitch
This New Era be cappin', uh
Me, Sean, T off that Pusha T, ain't no pushing me, bro might put you on a tee
Dot my eyes and cross my T's, bro might put you six feet or bro gon' put you on your feet
But bro can't put you on to me, A plus pussy worth a B, nigga, uh
You niggas ain't with no B, f*ck outta here

I keep dying in my dreams, but life's great when I stay woke
Bet you love dreaming, that's the only time you ain't broke
Try me, .40 make you back up off me like Dej Loaf and Big Sean
Get triggered down, Jhene Aiko
Gotta keep Glock in the fanny, nigga, you not finna ham me, huh
Put a body on a ratchet, I feel like Dr. Miami
Niggas tryna ride my wave like they stopping a taxi
On a six, in a Lamb', but I'm not that bitch Mary (Helluva made this beat, baby)

Four-one
They counted me out, I came back with a vengeance
And back to back Benzes, back to back winning
Rap failed, oh well, gimme back my scale and a burn out cell, I'll grow clientele
Four-one P, I don't sell dreams, I wholesale P's, want half's nigga, don't call me
Don't insult me, wrist frosty, 'bout eighty what this shit cost me
Don't worry, I'll make it back before you sip coffee
I roll with hustlers n' bosses, bosses n' hustlers, had to find my hustle I was lost in the gutter
Got out that jam now its foreigns with the seats peanut butter
Bitch, it's BYLUG for life, never crossing my brothers

(Let's go)
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

I f*ck with 6 Mile, not too much the 7, they freed the 4s
That's your bitch, huh? Well, get her together, she fucking bro
You know them road trips still bring a dub in, sub in
Even if the party was seven, the strip club ten
I'm all in this bitch, tryna tether, I'm throwing dubs still
I put her in the Bentley, mansion rent free
Told her keep the G-Wagen plain, don't even tint these
Can't be fucking with a lame, dawg, you got her head big
300 a line for the Wock', I'm sipping red still
I know how the feds feel, I make it hard to catch me
'Cause selling corn still, code word for reggies
I ain't sign a deal yetm f*ck itm I don't need 'em
Everybody with me eatingm free my niggas 'til I see 'em
He ain't dead, we ain't even jet back, ante up, bitch
Free them boys

(Shit hard)
(Where you at, Bo?)

We gon' make it off the ave, get a half, then I shake it
Somethin' like a bad habit, we ain't have it, we gon' take it
Came up off a fifty slab, now my bag big as yappers
Workers begging me for time off, asking me for raises
Took me six hours to count it, bubble wrap it up and tape it
All my bitches want allowance, plug asking me for favors
I been out of town so long, had to get reacquainted with the neighbors
On the block all these cash we been raking

Way before the rap when I was writing verses
We was beating up the Ike like I was Tina Turner
We was loading up the Glock and filling up the hearses
Now I'm preaching like it's Sunday, tryna teach the sermon
Trying to teach 'em how to get it fill up they mama purses
So they ain't standing in front of judge listing to the verdicts
'Cause we was standing on the block thugging with the serpents
Get caught with Curtis Blow on me and they gon' close the curtains

Million dollar cars you can't merge in, BasedGod how I got my curse lift
She gon' play her part so well you thought that she rehearsed it
Don life worship, holly temple, synagogue, tabernacle, churches

Yeah (Hit-Boy)
Look, I can't even chill I get active, overdoing everything my best and worst habit
Shit be impossible 'til it happens, I never thought I'd see Kobe go before Magic
That taught me first, no seconds to waste, only waist I like is her legs wrapped around my face
F*ck you think she doing over here, watching Netflix?
Beard game, might just let it grow down to my necklace
I don't hope for wins, I expect it, uh, adrenaline in me like it got injected
My girl said I got communication issues, no I don't
I just don't like sharing all my problems more than the results
I bring the plan back to my team, tell 'em go wild
God body, my physique, and my profile
I did every single goal that I wrote down, checked it off it's old now
And that shit give me chills, f*ck I gotta take yours
I'm the originator, make it then I make more, written in stone, you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same building on the same floor
Oh boy, black out, dough boy, cash out, payroll
Contract maxed out, cash kid, cash cow, tapped in, I can't tap out
Bitch, keep thinking I'm sleeping in, it's Tony on the monitor, I see your ass creeping in
Little bitch, if it weren't for me you wouldn't exist, you get the gist?
F*ck a cease and desist, they shooting up seats in exits
Throwing plays to my bros, I'm leading the league in assists
Hop scotch, black top, I ain't been skipping a step since
Real estate, Zillow every day, bitch, I might just change my profession
Dodged so many rainy days, it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested

(Let's go then)

Hmm, f*ck the bullshit, I ain't here to make no friends, can't get bool with me
Since an adolescence, I was ignorant, up in school tripping
Pistol at my desk, I was sitting up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket, play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick, both balls licked, and do it to me (what else?)
Ain't go to college, I ain't want no pussy nigga rooming with me
Still coulda went to college, Sada ain't no fool, nigga
Every clip we got extended, yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on you niggas, scrap them boys for half a biscuit
You know I like the burner but I'll beat your ass, this shit personal, huh
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh

(Yeah, go Royce)

Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artist, don dada, to G
Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather and P
D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada and T
Standing on the corner three days, phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or a gold Ellesses 
These are ordered from the older East Bay's
She either rolling with the owners or the lessee
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothing
I thought I told you mother fuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide got arenas buzzin'
We survived getting fronted by Ilina cousin
Before you could sell like Cole and Adele 
Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight as been fixed since the opening bell
And you know who posting your bail? Who promoting your L?
Who be hoping you fail? Nigga, Oprah and "
587,leaving heaven,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37920578/Eminem/Leaving+Heaven,"Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (yeah)

Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""F*ck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the f*ck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (what?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
A God but a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the f*ck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

I'm leaving Heaven (yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (you know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (f*ck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (you know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)

So you better, you better run (yeah)
You better, you better run (so I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (cocksucker)
You better, you better run (see you in Hell)"
588,marsh,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648718/Eminem/Marsh,"My name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (out of it)
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm startin' to sound like ALF a bit
Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills
Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb
But the word, ""Fuckin'"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Hoe thinks her snatch is magical but that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact it'll be nothing to throw that little bitch with a capital B 
Out the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds
A pad and a pen'll be great but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisible Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger
And crapped it, I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch my name is

My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (this world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra (extra) terrestrial (yeah)
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial (skrrt)

Yeah
I could keep beefing, f*ck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in hell but I should get puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said gave you an L, in hell
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growin' up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy!""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head say, ""It's still a dream""
Then he said, ""Kill MCs""
Trippie Redd, with pills on lean
Sippin' meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

My name's Marsh and I'm out this world (this world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra (extra) terrestrial (yeah)
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial (skrrt)

Yeah
So all of y'all can just suck a penis (suck a penis)
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (like cunnilingus)
There ain't no stopping it (there ain't no stopping it)
They say I'm such a genius (they say I'm such a genius)
When that Kamikaze hit (when that kamikaze hit)
Now they call me ""Butterfingers"" (they call me ""Butter fingers"")
'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
You wanna butt heads? Shut up Beavis, ha ha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (bitch)
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dug out (yeah)
I should just live in a nut house
Right now, I live in an igloo (yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the f*ck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (yeah)
So why, w-w-w-why else, would I call myself an alien?
How could I hit a dry spell (yeah), I'm named after the wetlands

I'm Marsh and I'm out this world (this world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
Call me extra, extra (extra) terrestrial (yeah)
My name is Marsh and, my name is, my name is
My name is Marsh"

We cop new timepieces when these fools deny Jesus
Hate is a sin dog, be real
(I got my hand on the pump)
You on Twitter in your feels
Throwin' subs, arguin' with chicks
I pray for these niggas, same hands that I hustle with
Passin' the offering plates, I'm the preacher in foreign whips
Sermons and politics, miracles come with each and every flip
That dinero from zero, so heaven-sent
Immaculate, blessings from Mary, I reminisce
On days we was broke, all we had was some common sense
Last night, I had a nightmare, I was at the stove
I woke up in Paris, cookin' up for Hov
That's why I thank the Lord for givin' me this life
And even when I'm gone, the music keepin' us alive
Yeah, it's called forever-ever
Ever-ever, ever-ever, family ties

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
I'm so grateful, all I need is love
To the Lord above

G6 globals, who'da thunk it, from the projects
Eight balls, some poppy, went and dunked it in the Pyrex
Mischievous thoughts 'fore seein' the sauce
Told Montana in the G, chicky poo in the Porsche
The Frank Sinatra of the Spanish mobsters
We the Jimmy's Cafe, ain't no need for operas
Had the fiends scream, ""Hallelujah,"" f*ck the prosecutor
Gave my nigga fifty years, and he was not the shooter
When they see us, solitar' confinement
Dig deep in your mind, no pressure, no diamonds
So we live a life, drop a hundred at the ferry, yeah
My chick's from San Fran, but stay out my bae area
You salute the cross, or you rebuke the cross
Either way you meet the Lord when you get moved across
Death knockin' at your door got you squeezin' handles
And you ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel

And I've been good, oh
All I need is love
To the Lord above

I'm sittin' here, reminiscin', think I just got a light bulb
Somethin' I'd like to mention, this is just on a side note
Word to the Terror Squad, Joe, this is all puns aside though
I know me and Mariah didn't end on a high note
But that other dude's whipped, that pussy got him neutered
Tried to tell him this chick's a nut job before he got his jewels clipped
Almost got my caboose kicked, fool, quit, you not gon' do shit
I let her chop my balls off, too 'fore I lost to you, Nick
I should quit watchin' news clips, yeah
My balls are too big, I should be talkin' pool
'Cause I got scratch, so my pockets full when I'm takin' shots at you
F*ck it, lemme chalk the cue stick
I'm over the top, like Cool Whip
And I promise you the day I fall off or lose it
I will stop and cut off the music
Opportunist, wanna kill shit every chance that I got to do this
Stackin' my guap, savage, I'm not
To fool with, like a handgun, you could say I'm like a gat when it's cocked
I keep it a (buck, buck), your ass'll get shot
If rap was an actual Glock, you'd act like you're strapped when you're not
Only cap that you pop is the top on the can of your pop
You the man 'til I pop your top
You ain't Jack in a Box
And I ain't talkin' a hamburger spot
Cracker with the barrel, armed to the teeth, Anderson .Paak (yeah)
Rest in peace to Afeni and her son Pac
You sent me that plaque with his rhyme sheet, I haven't forgot (nah)
Blow 30 million in a month, call it Brewster's Millions
Just hope I don't lose the feelin', from soldier to civilian
Got everything I need but I don't even see myself in the future chillin'
Only thing I don't have in the booth's a ceiling, just call me the roofless villain
They tellin' me sky's the limit, so I got my head in the clouds
Unicorn in human form, saw a gift horse, looked him dead in the mouth
(And Lord) And Lord, good lookin' out, for sendin' me Edna and Charles
Whenever mom kicked me out of the house
They were the bomb, then you sent me L-L
All the times that I hated myself, since eleven or twelve
Only way that I knew how to better myself is when I'm bet against by everyone else
So Joe hit the head on the nail
You ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel
I was gun shy, but now like a snail
The slug's comin' out of its shell

Oh, there's no hate in this world
That can make me give up
That can keep me stuck
Lord, I thank you (Lord, I thank you)
I thank you, I'm so grateful, so thankful, so thankful (so thankful)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, mm
I thank the Lord above

I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (she came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
That's the broke lingo (huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (hello)
Disrespect your life and I'm in gang mode (grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (huh)
I'm in cake mode (huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (brrr)
Collect pesos (huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (hey)
When the pain leaves (huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the Backwood is where the flame goes (there)
To the sky is where my brain goes (wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (what?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

Game over, Thanos on you H-Os
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (yeah)
Get the plunger (plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three SWATs
Or police officers at least to pull me off of it 
And I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 
'Cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards 
Who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic
It'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim
Better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone
Who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me 
Is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins
I'm God and the Lord forgives
Even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone 
When you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube
And The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music
The more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling, ""bombs away,"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (f*ck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy
They call me Kanye crazy
""APESHIT,"" Beyonce, Jay-Z
And I'm back with Andre, baby
And the doctor's operating
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K.Dot to Shady

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect
I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet
Now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips
All the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you
I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the f*ck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that as a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (f*ck you), I'm unaccommodating"
591,no regrets,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648617/Eminem/No+Regrets,"(Oh) yeah (yeah, yeah)
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (oh, oh)
I wouldn't change shit (oh, oh)
(DA got that dope)
I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets""

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low
The 'Vette look like a storm (screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm

Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (woo)
Tin brain, probably fucked in the membrane
Slim Shade, minds in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame
(Screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet
(I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"")

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low
The 'Vette look like a storm
(Screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
Yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost

Yeah
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the killshot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt
Should've never made a response to the disdain for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill
(I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"") Can't do it, nah

You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest
I made you a star (I'm screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low
The 'Vette look like a storm (screamin' out, ""No regrets"")
No regrets though, no white flags either
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm"
592,farewell,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648657/Eminem/Farewell,"(Ricky Racks)
For what it's worth
You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd f*ck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with, but this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?

Probably 'cause I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, fight, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find
To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line
But nothing comes to mind besides the number 90
'Cause since '06, you flipped my fucking life upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows
Make it rain upwards, we're on that ninth cloud
Two insane lovebirds, I should fly south
'Cause man, am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, ""F*ck it,"" cry our eyes out

Then I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax, then dump your ass in the bathtub
Yeah, now that's love
May sound pathetic, but f*ck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane 'bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending would be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we're not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a fifty cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner see, addiction is a disease

I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

(Love you girl, do you feel the same?)
(I don't wanna play games, no games, ah, ah)
(You're the only that can out my flame)
(Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah)"
593,never love again,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648667/Eminem/Never+Love+Again,"I could be with anybody, I choose you
Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd used you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""
Next I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up
Then I got you totally open as soon as I take your top off
You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
My friends say you're bad for me, hogwash

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back

Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in Saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the f*ck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back

So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality, somehow it seems like
When I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep, you're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my Valium, I'm an addict you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiends how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G-O-D
I thought you loved me, but you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
F*ck all you

Fuckin' bitch
We're done"
594,premonition ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36801889/Eminem/Premonition+%28Intro%29,"Yeah
So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
My joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the f*ck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or the Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (yeah)
I'm L. L. Cool J, bigger and deffer, that's how come (uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (what?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by"
595,walkthrough!,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/6082792/Eminem/WALKTHROUGH%21,"Look, I can walk you through the depths of hell
Where vets rejects elect the cell
Keep TECs to protect your tail, don't respect the mail
To blaze a separate trail, 'cause, uh, they was inept as well
Inherited they debt, we set to fail, please reset the scale
Niggas clappin' on Saturday, but we ain't see SNL
No comedy skits, just llamas and sticks and drama and shit
Baby mamas and jits, piranhas in pits, and brought up the bitch
Honestly, it's only right I get a zombie as a fix
This bass to your face from a speaker make you a tweaker
I laced it with ether
It'll take you a week to bounce back off one hit of this
Niggas is clitoris, way too frivolous
This is far more dire, the bars is hardcore
Like parkour with barbed wire
GRIP is the dark horse that spark wars and start fires
Hole in one on a par four or higher, and your supplier
Tour guide for hire, poor guy, he's tired
Cut him some slack, he's strapped raps to his back

Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Pulling from the script but the sides are empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Pulling from the script but the sides are empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world

Yeah
Sometimes I wonder really what did my closed head injury do?
I'm literally missin' a screw, but it seems like
My memory's too vivid to forget the shit I been through (Yeah)
So as my residuals grew, I remembered those kids who were cruel
Same individuals at Elizabeth Little
And essentially used them as the fuel
Who would've knew what the pencil could do, though, so mentally screwed
They said ""Marshall, you're either gonna wind up dead
Or in a penitentiary, 'cause eventually you'll end up clenchin' a tool
And come back vengefully to shoot them bullies
Who clowned you in elementary school""
Yeah, my head, something's wrong with it (Yeah)
But that makes me me, I'm different (Yup)
That lyrical phenom misfit
Since I was a bleach blonde who hear the beat on
This which makes me only think of demonic shit (what?)
I was knockin' on death's door (yeah), I fucking ding-dong ditched it
(Ha, yeah), yeah, and I don't do that sing-song bitch shit
And I don't use autotune, all I do is spit, and this shit just bothers you
Call it quits bitch, impossible
My pen just popped your thought-balloon, you dipshits know how I'ma do it
Send a motherfucking beat to the trauma-unit, yeah, Shady Records
Look at all these squad killers we brought with us
Juggernauts and Godzillas, you don't rock with us you're off of your rockers
Bitch, backs to the wall
Is it always, is why I'm not talkin' about wallets and knots
When I say that the wall it is not against
It's more like the cross
Look at how far this is past you
Regardless you want me to reach a fuckin' bar that does not exist
No pun intended, but GRIP, hold on to this moment
'Cause soon as you reach the top, they're gon' want you to fall from it
So you better grab your seatbelt
Like I did mine, and fasten yours
Like a motherfucking plane-crash passenger
'Cause one day you'll be crashing back to earth
And if you don't ever stop to smell the roses
I do know one thing, that's for sure
You don't get your flowers 'til you pushin' up daisies
And that's about all your ashes earn

Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Pulling from the script but the sides are empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Pulling from the script but the sides are empty

This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being done in

Call this evil intent, like me in a limo (yeah)
Like the shade in these windows
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
But no way they can see in though (nah)
OJ blade is a pencil (yeah)
Propane takin' my cranium
Code name Titanium Temple
I almost swallowed my car
I call my Mercedes a Benzo

Ball like J, but not Jay as in
Jay-Z, J as in Leno
'Cause I got a huge mansion
No, huge man chin, new Manson, loose cannon
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
The kinda crazy you can't fix
I'm still the one your parents hate
I'm in your house eatin' carrot cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight
Into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Dre's on concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it's a staircase

Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go

Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe

Stop dwelling, then stop yelling
I'm not yelling, you're yelling
Smart-aleck, goddammit
F*ck is that? Stop hammering (Goddamn)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics'll get slain
Like they were strangled with bicycle chains
You're gonna have to come identify the remains, wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie (yup)
Can't get a fuckin' word in edgewise (shut up)
Success overnight like a red eye (bitch)
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm hot, dawg, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Chick ran up like, ""Marshall, on fire""
I looked down and said, ""No, I'm not, you're a liar""
She said, ""No, your music
Heard you're back with the Doctor,"" then I heard

Two shots back for my dearly departed, uh
You are now dealin' with a monster, boss shit, profits

You're fucking with the original, flow's sick
And anybody can get it, COVID
You fuckin' with that?
I done wrote shit that was so sharp 
I could slit my own fucking throat with it
So rich, I got more chips than my shoulders
And I'm about as approachable as a roach is (roach is)
Yeah, so better steer clear from him
Here comes a nuclear bomb for your eardrums
Lyricism at its most fearsome and fierce
We are on another tier like a tear duct's upper echelon (yeah)
Your career subbing me (what?), It was sheer luck (like what?)
Like a fuckin' leprechaun with its beard cut
(Still a) punisher, weapon drawn with a beer gut
You're slower than a Decepticon with its gear stuck
(And I what?) I serial kill, and you're Kellogg's
I love checks and I hate tricks
And you're a fake bitch (bitch)
I could spot you like you 'bout to weight lift (yeah)
Bitch, I'm badder than cake mix

You cunts must be out of your labias
And God is my alias, so if I don't have faith in me
Then it basically makes me an atheist (woo)

In a chokehold and a sleeper (yeah)

But, like a Doberman, I'm a whole different breeder (what?)
Animal mutt mixed with a overachiever (yeah)
Oh, you're the king of rap? You're about to be overthrown
Like a pass over the head of an open receiver
At least you can end up comin' to blows like a wiener
But, I ain't finish puttin' these hoes through the ringer (nah)
Like clothes in between the two roll is a weight
No, what I mean is flow's interwoven, I treat 'em like thread (why?)
That's how I wound up sewin' machine up
So, fucks if you don't give up me the time to ride or die (yeah)
'Cause you're either both or you're neither (yeah)
Throw a middle finger up (yeah) if you're rollin' (yeah)
But, me, I'm gonna-

Ride 'til I die

Take 'em to church, I'm talkin' the tabernacle
It's the return of the body snatcher
Walk in the spot, make my woman smack ya (whoo!)
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's apple
Pull up in the candy car, eatin' a candy bar
And my girl eatin' a candy apple
Yeah, I line their ass up, I aim at their Cruiser
All of these stones on my neck, uh
They must have looked at Medusa
Pockets Rasputia of course
I drove some rims to court
I fucked some twins before
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report
This is the murder, murder, pass the burner, Em
Your money shorter than an acronym
Big body when I'm backin' in
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies
Niggas fakin', niggas human traffickin' (whoo!)
I'm on the Ac' again, uh
This ain't a accident, uh
King like Ak-Ron
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill (treadmill)
Never, Neverland, shit came with a Ferris wheel (goddamn!)
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car
Most of y'all my sons, aww, look at little JR
F12 same color Kate Moss
Uh, I'm talkin' wrist in the pot
I'm talkin' this and you not
I'm talkin' bricks and you not
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock
This is the equinox, this what the people want
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
These bitches got flavors
They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor
But they shoppin' at Raleys, they stingin' like tasers
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor
We eatin' that chicken, lobster, potatoes
You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Swagger on ten since a day old
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo
Every track is a K.O., technical K.O.
Go off your head like I'm Ayo
Out of this world, talkin' NATO
It's 'cause of jail, don't be an A-hole
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so (lay low!)
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues
Real nigga, you ain't break no rules (hell yeah!)
High school, niggas ate yo' food
Might dumb it down a little, but I ain't no fool (hell yeah!)
Niggas hate every day, B (yeah)
Shit is O.C. lately (yeah)
Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats (yeah)
Or I might go crazy (hell yeah!)
These niggas too goddamn lazy (too lazy)
Don't ever, ever, ever try to play me (to play me)
Lil' shawty know a nigga from BK (BK)
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (like JAY-Z)
Nothin' but love from my heart (love from my heart)
I feel entitled to titles (to titles)
F*ck it, man, I want the title (I want the title)
Submission, they goin' all viral

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi and the Taliban plotting an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent
Up on a little like Osama with a bomb under the bin
And down the middle of the Pentagon
And hit a kindergartener with a rental (stop!)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
""Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?"" (huh?)
""Why you always gotta smack a whore?"" (huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (huh?)
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, ""'Walk On Water' sucks""
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it
So you formed your verdict
While you sat with your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (wait, Em!)
But nowadays, every flow, every cadence sound the same (skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta space
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara
To ""How can I be down?"", all of us tryna pile in the car (yeah!)
We shot for the stars (yeah!)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (yeah!)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the f*ck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face
And practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
""Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyoncé this and Kehlani that"" (yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
To the body bag, I'll be back
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like

Like Chloraseptic"
599,black magic,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/2448667/Eminem/Black+Magic,"Black magic, night walker (yeah)
She haunts me like no other (feel like)
Nobody told me (I don't know) love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (but it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (it's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains

We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
Last time I broke her collar bone, she's intolerable (yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phenomenal, though
We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
People don't like us together but like we care (not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals for her with both of my feet bare (yeah)
But soon as I asked to hit (asked to hit), it's like she grabs a switch (grabs a switch)
Turns me over her knee, 'cause my ass is whipped
Yeah, and I got her back, but I'm spineless (yeah)
So when she stabs me in mine (yeah), it's like I just can't feel the knife (what)
As she pokes, jabs it and slices
One minute she'll build me up (up)
The next, she'll push me 'round
Probably why she calls me ""Dumbbell""
She lifts me up (yeah), then puts me down (huh)
But I am under her thumbnail
I must be under her spell
It's like lookin' right into a gun barrel
But none of these hoes can f*ck with my girl
She got that

Black magic, night walker
She haunts me like no other
Nobody told me love is pain, oh
Black magic, dark water
Surrounds me like no other
She's got my heart in chains

We wake up, break up, make up
Like Maybelline, now she's all made up like make believe
Probably why she's so fake to me
But what the f*ck's it gonna take for me to make her see?
Strip her naked and take her keys
I been plannin' this day for weeks but I can't tell if I'm wake or sleep
Or if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain
I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
But hurt by her motherfuckin' hairs
All I imagine, dragon
She lunges, attacks, and scratches
But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
Like Kaep for the National Anthem
As I stab, I'm laughin'
So much for witchcraft and magic
Abracadabra that bitch
No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
I give her one last hug, goodbye
Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
But in hindsight, think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
As I pop another five Vic's
That's what this high's like
Look down, there's blood on my Nikes
Shovel at my side, blood on my mic
Now wake up to music to be murdered by

600,discombobulated,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/2448804/Eminem/Discombobulated,"Oh, ayo, Dre
I'm discombobulated
Let's take 'em back (accents)
In time (everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this

Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, f*ck, I'm discombobulated

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So baby, please, take off your clothes
(No) yes (no) yes (no) no (yes) oh (oh), yeah

Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (haha)
F*ck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw
And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup
Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute
'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (yeah)
Wizard of 'ahs' and 'ohhs'
Same Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice
Who also used to sound like Nas on ""Live at the Barbeque""
Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you

Like, au jus, but beef, if like
""I was you,"" but, like, ah, f*ck you (man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So baby, please, take off your clothes
(No) yes (no) yes (no) no (yes) oh (oh), yeah

I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking shi-dit
Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the f*ck?

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So baby, please, take off your clothes

601,vegas,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/11374/Eminem/Vegas,"Got a shit-eatin' grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your frigity-friends
I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like this shit's hoppin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't
Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the f*ck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
(Squee!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost
'Till we get to Las Vegas

(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)

'Till we get to Las Vegas

Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
Til we get to Las Vegas

Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the f*ck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said saint, por favor
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas

(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)
Vegas

Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
Til we get to Las Vegas"

I don't trust a soul, I don't even trust my bitch (uh-uh)
Before I fall in love, I'd rather cut my wrist (ahh)
I sweat Ace of Spades, nigga, that's how much I sip
Body a rap nigga quick before the Dutch got twist (ayo, let's roll somethin')
Yeah, the shotty ring, this shit is not a thing (uh-huh)
The chopper make your body lean, my niggas body things (brr)
Uh, I'm with the jackboys, I'm with the robbin' team (uh-huh)
On my mama, I never rocked a pair of Robin jeans (hahahaha)
Everything I jot is mean, how you gon' stop Machine?
My name, it probably ring like Las Vegas slot machines (talk to 'em)
The MAC by my pelvis in my Helmut Lang (uh-huh)
The shells'll bang, make everything outta your helmet hang
Uh, the mayo jar was Hellmann's when I swirled the 'caine
Then I wrapped the yayo up in cellophane (woo)
My shooter got Dame Lillard from the elbow aim
I thought of that while I was courtside at the 'Melo game (ah)
Bricks are off-white, I imported some (uh-huh)
Whippin' all night until the mornin' come (all night, nigga)
Still pitchin' long nights until my fortune come
That's big checks on the side like the Off-White Jordan 1s, ugh!

Growin' up, everybody mama loves you on crack
We got bodies (got bodies, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
With the masters of Pinoy
My nigga did five, he came home with a kilo' (yeah)

I was listenin' to Stan with Coke flippin' in the pan
I brought enough quarters back to go scrimmage with the Rams (let's go)
When it comes to my plug (uh huh)
It won't fit in the sedan
Comparin' us, you can't do it, it's like Timberlands to Vans
Official only, you know that, pistol under the floor mat
Been hated on more than Jesus, locked up more times than Kodak
The pots handy, pitched for my family like Sandy Koufax
Gave my connect a fresh hundred grand and he hand me dope back
Blocks and jail walls to spots on the Billboard (uh)
Posted up in them traps and they knocked until dawn (ayo, who that?)
The foreigns ain't cheap and these watches still cost (skrrt, ah)
Glocks so big, one shot knock your wheels off

I used to be a man of the people
Hit the clubs and mingle (what up?)
Used to dream one day I'd be fuckin' Pink 
Like a flamingo (Pink)
That was back when I smoked Canibous
Man, but it was tough, 'cause I was a fan of his
So it sucked to hand him his ass, but
Yeah, lookin' back on my feuds
How me and Ja Rule almost got cool
'Cause we shot pool back in '01
Was it '02? I don't know, but
Something told me fuckin' not to
Then we got stuck in high school
I shoved an Oscar up his wazoo

Yeah, but I think of the rappers I slayed and buried like every night
And every career I might've killed, sometimes I say a prayer and I
Wonder is there a heaven for a G? And if so, is the sanctuary nice?
Studios for rap like Coolio, shootin' craps at gangster's paradise

Huh, here a mic, there a mic
Everywhere a mic, share and share alike
But just don't compare alike
Instead of comparin' me, pick a fair fight
Compare me to lightnin', that similarity's strikin'
Compare me to Jaws
Compare me to Manson, Marilyn or Charles
Compare me to Nas, Biggie, or Pac
Do not compare me to that Iggy bitch
Or all this fuckin' Milli Vanilli hip-hop
This is where all that silly shit stops
Compare me to the pistol that triggered this thought
The semi, the Glock, 9 millis get cocked
I'm sending a shot
Don't come around with them floss raps tryna stunt
Compare me to Meek, big wheelies get popped
One by one, compare 'em to scabs, I'm picking them off
They're going home to f*ck Nicki Minaj, aw
Compare me to Diggity-Das, yah
I'm hickity-hitting it raw, ha

In the trailer park (haha)
Told her I'd play the part like Kanan Stark's
Ate her twat like a Tater Tot, oh shit
Get the strap like a trainin' bra
Lunchtime like at eight-o'clock
But Shady's not for the faint of heart
Goin' at these pricks like Lorena Bobbitt
Y'all want drama, we can make a scary movie like Marlon Wayans
Y'all lookin' at the charred remains of Charlamagne tha God
Slim whip, Westside, and Conway are not playin'
I cock back, aim, and I spray ya like (bang)"
603,in too deep,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648654/Eminem/In+Too+Deep,"""This could never work,"" is what we said at first
But whatever this is, it's working
But we're in two different worlds and (yeah)
I'm not your husband (nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (what?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say this is me without you
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

I'm not happy here (nah), with her (mm)
Rather have you (yeah), rather have me too (ooh)
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there) with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we're just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)

You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, whoa
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""where the f*ck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are gettin' super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheatin' on her with you or cheatin' on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't ever hear us talk
'Cause we both are gettin' sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

I'm not happy here (nah), with her (mm)
Rather have you (yeah), rather have me too (ooh)
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there) with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we're just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)

We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya, starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month, I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so keep it a hunnid, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

I'm not happy here (nah), with her (mm)
Rather have you (yeah), rather have me too (ooh)
'Cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there) with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we're just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)"
604,epmd 2,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/5966261/Eminem/EPMD+2,"Respectfully

Bucket on low like Erick and Parrish
Closed casket flow, all you niggas get deaded
They don't give you one single rose while you can smell it
So I pick from my own garden (garden)
Wanna go out in my garden like Godfather
Grandkids and a Rottweiler, got over the block trauma (yeah)
So what you sayin' nigga? You gots to chill (uh-huh)
Thinkin' you the truth, really you not for real (EPMD)
Back to back with' it, the hardest shit of the year (Nasir Jones)

(Remix)
EPMD, we back in business
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us, come to your senses (uh)
P is the second coming of God something to witness
Piece of shit fly on your head like Mike Pence's
We in the trenches
I'm mad, better yet, I'm on a rampage
My people can't even get minimum wage
F*ck a stimulus (uh)
Give me some interest (uh)
Give me a loan
Give me a home
Get me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome
Best wishes, ghost 'em like he Tommy
Ain't worried bout nothin' 'cause Hit Squad behind me

EPMD, we back in business
I visualize what is it, not what is isn't
We at the mafia table next to the kitchen
Eatin' Michelin Stars, countin' a million

Dun
I let it go for the family, meetin's at Cote in Miami
Them wine bottles on maggie, extra large
Sign up for my masterclass, Escobar
Feet up at Mets Stadium at my restaurant (yerr)
Tied in from AZ to Dave East, you know my thoughts get crazy
My teachers, they couldn't grade me
I know some Haitians in Dade County, got choppers in Haiti
She booked a flight to Colombia, made her body amazin'
Just to post it on Tumblr, this that ""f*ck up the summer"" shit
I don't care what you comin' with, me and Hit-Boy runnin' shit (runnin' shit)
Big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (yeah, flooded now)
Pull up with the Ghost like a haunted house (haunted house)
Shit gettin' scary, blood on my hands like Carrie
Might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
I said it was dead, but it faked its death like Machiavelli
You see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti

Yeah, ready?
EPMD, we're back in business (what?)
Livin' in cramped conditions, we'll give you ammunition
Stock them shelves, I got more shells like Taco Bell and I'm not gon' fail
I got no L's like Christmas, you don't wanna make the claws come out (nah)
Y'all should call yourselves Santa (why?) 'Cause none of y'all are real (nah)
Not a single one (like what?), Like a dollar bill (yeah)
It's like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill
We got her a bond and she'll
Never bail on me, not even outta jail
EPMD, but me, I gots no chills (you gotsa chill)
Just a lotta skrill
Lady, my paper's so crazy, I just tossed a mil' out the window
Of my mobile on the fuckin' freeway on the way here (yeah)
Like Rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
That's a lot of bucks flyin' when I'm makin' it rain, dear
Green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
A pocket full of pills, some are Tylenol 3s, prolly two or three Molly
So some are E which reminds me of rap summary, mami
My theme song, me and P
Always used to play that shit on repeat all day
So please call me ""Big Daddy"" (daddy)
Plus I got the 'caine and lean on me (yeah)
MCs, I'm eatin' you B-I-T-C-H's like tortilla chips
Me, I'm free of debt, yeah, green is on Chia Pet
This is the effects of my old neighborhood misery index
Poverty at it's peak, OCD and PTSD I guess
R.I.P. out to DMX, Stezo, E and Nipsey
Ecstasy and Prince Markie Dee, MF DOOM, I hit 50 via text
Told him that I love him 'cause I don't even know when I'ma see him next (nah)
Tomorrow could be your death (yeah, what?) (Bring that beat back)
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'Cause the brain's iller trained, killer, danger, deranged
And I drank all the DayQuil, I blank on the paper
Then wait 'til the page fill up
Hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
I just pray for the day when I'm able to say that I'm placed
With the greats and my name's with the Kane's and the Wayne's and the Jay's
And the Dre's and the Ye's and the Drake's and the J Dilla's, Jada's, Cool J's
And the Ra's and amazin' as Nas is, and praise to the Gods of this
Shout to the golden age of hip-hop and the name of this song is 

EPMD, we back in business
I visualize what is it, not what is isn't
We at the mafia table next to the kitchen
Eatin' Michelin Stars, coutin' a million"
605,those kinda nights,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648632/Eminem/Those+Kinda+Nights,"Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
(D.A. got that dope)
It's one of those kinda nights

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' a cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the Motel 8
Yeah, Bizzare's tryna get a lapdance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like, ""Goddamn""
She's like, ""That's harassment""
I'm like, ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a Bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy
She said, ""F*ck off"", and threw her liquor at me
(It's one of those kinda nights)
(Then I said, I said)

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights

This beat keeps takin' me back, like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God, my whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on?"" Ah (haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?"", I said, ""No, I'm high""
I'm checkin' out the chick, she said, ""So am I""
What's in the cup? Let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda 

O-M-G
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Says she wants go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot
Here comes the brigade
Turnt like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay, me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over""
She said, ""No problemo"", windows are dark tint
Roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're hoein'
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no-one
I'm high and you're bi
I'm comin', you're going

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights"

620,darkness,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1648673/Eminem/Darkness,"I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium
Then chase it with booze, one little taste it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
F*ck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a Benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud, but it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound, I should get ready for the show now
Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax and just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack, you can't murder a show nobody's at
But what if nobody shows?
Panic mode 'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show, just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
The press is 'bout to go apeshit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, 'nother Valium fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the Scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
F*ck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin' but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Kaiser Soze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of 'em John Travolta, stayin' alive by inches
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh, f*ck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over, no suicide note
Just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness 
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello darkness, my old friend)

Yeah, we do have some breaking news from the Associated Press right now
Just gonna bring that up, because we are hearing
We have told you that the shooter is dead
And we have just learned that police are saying that the Las Vegas shooter killed himself
That is the bartender there at Mandalay Bay
And I believe we're going to hear more from here
Yeah, we just wanted to share that with you
You can see behind me here, this is what he looks like
Now, we did just tell you that police just earlier
Metro was telling us that he killed himself inside the hotel room

Good morning, as we come to you on the air
We bring you breaking news, a school shooting (crushing news)
Another school shooting (eleven people dead)
Reports of a number of fatalities and this time in Santa Fe, Texas
That is just outside Galveston (that no one saw coming)
A mass shooting a Southern California school

This one in Santa Fe, Texas, that's just outside Houston
Twenty-six killed and twenty other wounded (Houston affiliate is reporting)
At least nine people have been killed (somber words, making it the deadliest shooting in Texas history)
Five people dead
The attacker opening fire outside the church during a morning worship session

This, a deadly shooting at a food festival in Northern California
Three people, so far, dead
Breaking news (fifteen wounded)
A deadly shooting at a newspaper office in Annapolis (a gunman opened fire)
Newly released surveillance video shows the moments leading up to a mass shooting

Ride with 'em, roll with the, whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell 'em, ""Ride with 'em,"" we could ride with 'em
Ride with 'em, whoa, we could, whoa, whoa, whoa
I tell the odd, gotcha, odd, getcha, woo, what
Check it out, nigga, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Nigga, I need, we could fight with 'em, ride
Yeah, uh, yeah

Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
Protect yo' energy from poison when the python strike
My first mistake was doin' robberies on Nikon bikes
Watch my moves and I'ma show you what a icon like
Y'all let bygones be bygones, right?
Nigga, f*ck yo' truce, bust yo' move
And if that nigga touch your shoes
You better blast on 'em and on my mama, nigga
I'ma get that cash on 'em, hunnid on the dash on 'em
Swerve, born from the trench, you from the 'burbs
Nigga, f*ck the early bird, nigga
I'ma get this motherfuckin' chicken
And if a nigga ever got a problem, nigga
We can fuckin' solve it, on my mama, nigga
I just been itchin' to prove myself
I just pray throughout the struggle I don't lose myself
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell
But listen

I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

First and foremost, for every door that's opened, a door close
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road
A dead end, or prison time, where we was headin'
Instead, when I got bread, broke it with brethren
Eyes open, leave the house, move like a veteran
Made a couple dollars from come-ups, my niggas flexin'
Nigga got a problem, then I can make some corrections
Okay, cool, still with the same niggas since grade school
Give a f*ck about your Shade Room when I had made room
For everybody on that late moon, and word to Rae Sremm'
Had to bring the motherfuckin' swank on 'em
And I ain't even wanna have to blank on 'em
That Lamb' truck got a full tank on 'em
But, a nigga better not look at me wrong
It's certain shit that I can't say on this song, but let me tell you, nigga

I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan (yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

I done seen some shit within my lifetime, at one time I
Can still remember just how bad I used to want five mics
My biggest dream was just to make it into Unsigned Hype (word)
It's so hard for me to fathom this was once my life (yeah)
Shit'll make you wanna cop out like a plea deal (yeah)
So I treat a beat like it's Tekashi, spit on that bitch like Meek Mill
My addiction got me weak-willed (yup)
I'm relapsing, I think I can't seem to stop eating Beat Pills
And Doctor D-R-E he still keeps on givin' me refills
Send 'em at me, bullets hit indiscriminately
Women and men and little kids senior citizens 'til the Sig is empty
Whipped Gen-Z into a frenzy, but no gift, is in me, I'm stingy
And that is the motherfuckin' difference between them and me (who?)
And that's the reason I'm, in my Louis Vuitton (what am I?)
Gorier than Eva Long (yeah)
This rap shit, is somethin' that you'll never see me at 
Like senior prom (wait a minute what I mean)
What I mean's the bar's, higher than Cheech and Chong (yeah, wow)
When you give them each a bong (yeah)
I call my stan's a, fan club 'cause whoever it's unleashed upon (what?)
Fuckin' beats up on (bitch), like police batons (y'all are)
Y'all are window shoppers, bunch a Peeping Toms
Still got that bullseye on my back (back), red dot on my head (yeah)
Yeah, blood on my hands for some of the rhymes that I've said (why?)
Police squad on the task
Got 'em hot on my trail, like my stepfather with the belt, I got S.W.A.T. on my ass
I was painfully shy, now I'm proud of myself
Like Obama's kids, I came outta my shell (Michelle)
And I can promise this
On my mama, shit, no daughters, bitch (here we go now)
Yeah, every single word'll be true so with out further adieu
It's return of the ruthless more murderous than Mook is 
So what you're gonna do's think I'm allergic 
When I point this motherfuckin burner at 'chu (ah-choo)
I throw shade it'll be curtains for you
Pray for the verse to get through, birth of a new (yeah)
Worser me, who's determined to do
Permanent damage with the words that I threw 
Bird's-eye view I'm referred to as Zeus
Circlin' you like I'm a vulture features are tournaments, I turn 'em into
Turnin' me loose is like verbal abuse, language hurtful to use cursin' at you
Made a couple of mistakes that occurred in my youth 
Jumped a hurdle or two, word but I'm through
With tellin' you about the food stamps and the government cheese
And how we used to get school lunches for free
Already told ya, 'bout the holes up in my Pony shoes and Rustler jeans
When it was Mother, lil' brother and me
I told you 'bout, being kicked out 20 degrees, no money to eat (yeah)
'Bout the thrift stores and being piss poor 
The Christmases Ma had gifts for us, when bro and me discovered that she
Was wrappin' shit up around the house, to stick it under the tree

623,godzilla,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37465002/Eminem/Godzilla,"(Ugh, you're a monster)

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
Adhd, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (ayy, ayy)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster (ayy)
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em, ""Lick the balls""
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster (ayy)
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake) yeah
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
Or being the recievin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hunnid percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull the

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha"
624,shady cxvpher,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/10988/Eminem/Shady+CXVPHER,"My name is KXNG CROOKED, I snap on you rappers often
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we really lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like
B-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam
Like got damn
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop
Van Damme, karate chop
The Baretta's a better competitor
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot
And booku, booku, I'm cookoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapid
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
When I come back, that's it
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I
When I land, you wack niggas die
And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'
With their hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwords so their last words is ?
That's backwards for ""F*ck them damn niggas""
Buck them damn triggers
Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers
Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
But I only like dead rappers
Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to
I gotta cancel you now
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin'
I dwarf giants, I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sorta like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science
That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
That's where the fire's burnin'
Try to deny music's messiah returnin'
You die and you fry in my iron furnace
I am on my get rich and die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis cause I am murderous

(Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey)
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist
And if ain't a bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now
F*ck the cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
So it's f*ck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
Face says I been stressed
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Shit that bothered from the start
Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfathers heart
Yeah, just not decided to be his own
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
Not the how do I feel, not the how do I deal
If that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
But wait, wildest part of all of that is
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But f*ck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done

Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama

My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama
Here's the back story
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills
I don't know which one's which or what it's for
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt
I still drink till I end up being that klutz
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
I'll probably do it tonight
Leave the bar, leave the car
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
For unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar 
Thought it would be
Wait a minute, the lord and the god hate me
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
Nah
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
Wanna take a tour? Let's see
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
Books, bears, trucks, boats, tyres, spares, four-wheelers
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift gets low while there's chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
Ditsy flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass CEO
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
Guess who's coming to dinner?
André 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just a pet to feed of course
Who rides a horse in an ash field? I might
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
And mateys, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
Moonshine, gold watches, gold rings
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat
All the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
I don't know where that came from
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
Don't look under the tarp, sir
I'm growin' weed for my mama there
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley
And I did it my way
See, hip hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out

But these cyphers, I treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
Now they deem me a savior
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, I just really like rap
I'm not lucky, trust me
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky
With the shit that my pen states, these rappers can't touch me
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous
I was better than all you silly kids when I was tryna figure out who I really is
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
No rubber groove on my shoes had to fight, so suspensions
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter
That's 3 to 1, I learned that in public school too
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece"

Bumstickitty, bumstickitty, bum huh
I got that old rump-pum-pum-pum
A punk'll jump up to get him a beat down
At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound
My flow all over the place, .44 in the waist
I'm so-so innovative, po-po went away, I roll over 'em and make bacon
And call 'em a pig, won't you hop up off of my dick?
Words in the way, I'm at lost by 'em
I give you a JFK on the front lawn of MLK in the crossfire (get down, nigga)
I have evolved into the lost diaries of the mob and the Rothschilds
I feel like God brought the vials and I am just layin' down inside 'em like caulk and tile
Q-Tip

Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminals
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh uh, I survived it and that's a miracle
Ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (people), check yourself

Like Wu-Tang said, ""You should protect yourself"" (animals!)

Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

Yo, snappin' necks plus I'm live, in effect
I'm in the Slick Rick eyepatch, but I got it from Hex
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
For the God in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
They be like, ""You put the Thought on? Yikes""
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I'm the king of the blood sport, all mice
I'm from an era, you had beef? Y'all prolly fist fought on sight
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-ilitants
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm Coke buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars just like ASMR
All my dogs is at the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call my youngins takin' flight
You a bark, bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo
Vespucci, I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmost the Third, with seven inch herringbones

Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminals
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh uh, I survived it and that's a miracle
Ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse, check yourself

Better hope an ambulance is en route
Papers are hand grenades soon as I pull the pin out
I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
All combine into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
They call me five to nine, and thought duh-dun, duh-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out, like the Octo-Mom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist, tryna ball a fist I will
F*ck you just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had to give me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
Now here's to LL, Big L and Dell
K-Solo, Treach and G Rap
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
Ed OG, and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
King Tut, UTFO and Schoolly D, PE and BDP
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
From B-I-G and Paris B, Three Times Dope, and some we'll never see and PRT
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
Without him, I don't know where I'd be

I do my best to try to block it, redrum
I've been sipping on like, vodka, head's numb
I'm blacking out, you better watch it, it's bedlam

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start takin' off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Ferrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beatboxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ay, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks wanna rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
The nigga that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor, with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (pew)

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime, I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic, newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

And I don't think that I can stop it, here it comes

627,last one standing,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/6200486/Eminem/Last+One+Standing,"Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'

Uh, you weren't with me on the cold block nights
Now you front row for the spotlight
Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight
Young nigga on bullshit and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight, could've been a victim of an opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this 'cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many times God tested me, they only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs, tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently, if you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully, I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off so we felt the struggle so painfully

Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'

Yeah, you know the code we gotta live by
Never mind all the ice cubes on this wristwear in the big body
Live by the gun, get bodied or it's hella time in that cell
It was hella times where I failed, when I had to double back from them Ls
Bet he don't double back when he tell
'Cause it ain't no comin' back when you tell
Why would you leave me here by myself? A nigga be lonely
Ayy, I blew the whole bag on they flights, ain't leavin' the homies
If he really gang, then get him a chain, no cubic zirconies
White Zomb' in the stogey, stood firm, never folded
Furthest thing from a rodent, you put the jacket on and you bogus
Yeah, big dawg and they know it
I had to spin off to stay focused
Longev' on the motion
We don't abandon ship when it's hopeless
I done been broke before and they know

I make it look easy
Like I made it overnight
I make it look easy
But you don't see the dark side
And all of the monsters I had to fight (fight)
And all of the nightmares (nightmares)
Made me stronger than life (yeah)

Y'all say (what?), I've changed (huh)
Really, though? (Tell me), how so? (I got)
Got all (what?), this bread (yeah)
I'm still (what?), sour though (huh)
I don't know (I'm a), square peg (in a), round hole (yeah)
Like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
Rocky Balboa (I), never been no (what?), towel thrower
Even when I got kicked to the curb (yeah)
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment and hurt
To an unquenchable thirst, in the simplest terms
It's revenge of the nerd, in every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength and resilience (nah)
How I rack my brain but it feels as if I'm tryna explain it to children (damn)
So a lot of this pain isn't healin', no escapin' it, this anger is spilling
Almost like recreatin' a feelin' of 9/11 when the second plane hit the building
So let 'em paint you the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom (yeah)
Of havin' way too much income (mmm)
But when you struggled every day just to get some (yeah)
Now all of this hate is a syndrome (yuh)
When they can't relate, and that stems from (what?)
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green but those aren't leaves (leaves)
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and pray
Had to claw, scratch and fight my way
Just follow me, and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey (Skylar Grey)
And rappers, how can we be on the same level now
When I gotta look down and see these clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP to the height of 2003 me
You ain't see the struggle to make it out the D
Because I made it somehow look easy

Now you see me standin' in the lights
But you never saw my sacrifice
Or all the nights I had to struggle to survive
Had to lose it all to win the fight
I had to fall so many times (oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin' (oh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the last one standin'"
628,the storm ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1380245/Eminem/The+Storm+%5B%282017+BET+Hip-Hop+Awards+Cypher+Verse%29%5D,"It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot, oh yeah

That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks
She gets her mou—ahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for shit to quiet down
He'll just gas his plane up, and fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the fuckin' nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his fuckin' rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he can not withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
F*ck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin', ""Drain the swamp!""
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in–
–stead of talkin' Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
'Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignorin' our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, ""You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!""
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespectin' the military
F*ck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!
""He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!""
""He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!""
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm usin' all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
F*ck you!
The rest of America, stand up!
We love our military, and we love our country
But we fucking hate Trump!"
629,the monster ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/30064435/Eminem/The+Monster+%5BClean%5D,"I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shh to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

630,greg ,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/31041211/Eminem/Greg+%5BAcapella%5D,"Met a retarded kid name Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
F*ck an acid tab, I strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mamas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure"
631,airplanes part ii,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35370714/Eminem/Airplanes+Part+II,"Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(Dreamin', of fallin, dreamin', of fallin')

Let's pretend like its '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream 
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone)

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
F*ck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that

Airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)"

Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touched
Trust me, ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buck shots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops (pow)
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold ya
Motherfuck a soldier ready to roll or take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct (pin, explosion)
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' 'cause there's no stoppin' 'til they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon (boom)
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
F*ck bein' trapped, I'm a soldier

I betcha that's how I got some things you ain't got
That's called courage, and it don't come
From no flick or bottle, it ain't scotch
It's not bourbon, I don't walk around
Like no G 'cause that ain't me
I'm not that person, I don't try
To act like you do 'cause that ain't you
You just burpin', you ain't

2Pac in the mad bitch
In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the back seat nigga when we clown
Homey is you down? D got the strap and she anxious (click)
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit (tires peeling)
Comin' 'round the corner spittin' rounds, they can't hold me down
Caught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day stinkin' beotch!

I betcha that's how I got some things you ain't got
That's called courage, and it don't come
From no flick or bottle, it ain't scotch
It's not bourbon, I don't walk around
Like no G 'cause that ain't me
