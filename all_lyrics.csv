136,"Oh, this what we doin'? Alright (M.A.)

I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (she came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
That's the broke lingo (huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (hello)
Disrespect your life and I'm in gang mode (grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (huh)
I'm in cake mode (huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (brrr)
Collect pesos (huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (hey)
When the pain leaves (huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the Backwood is where the flame goes (there)
To the sky is where my brain goes (wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (what?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

Game over, Thanos on you H-Os
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (yeah)
Get the plunger (plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three SWATs
Or police officers at least to pull me off of it 
And I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 
'Cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards 
Who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic
It'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim
Better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone
Who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me 
Is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins
I'm God and the Lord forgives
Even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone 
When you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube
And The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music
The more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling, ""bombs away,"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (f*ck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy
They call me Kanye crazy
""APESHIT,"" Beyonce, Jay-Z
And I'm back with Andre, baby
And the doctor's operating
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K.Dot to Shady

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect
I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet
Now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips
All the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you
I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the f*ck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that as a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (f*ck you), I'm unaccommodating"

255,"Each time they take a photograph
I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide, this is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
I never admit it
But it hurts

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be war but I'm not going down

One little lie I can ruin my day
Words are like weapons they betray
When I am afraid, one word of kindness it can save me

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down

I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be war but I'm not going down

Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day I won't care
But for the moment I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes, and let you catch me now

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, oh yeah

I can't be superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now

180,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'til then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well

It will burn inside of me"

Not for who I am, but what I got, yeah
And, I don't wanna blow up her spot
But da-na-na-na-na-da-na (woo)
Lady, I've been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
Hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (yeah)
Been checkin' you out ever since the second you stepped in through Nani's dressing room
Girl, you're stunning, I'd bet that you'd zap me if I was next to you
Sparks'll fly, I expect them too
I'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're Carmen Electrocute (cutie)
And those ain't just sound effects, I knew something was special as soon as we swapped info
I knew that

She loves me, she loves me not
For who I am, but what I got
But she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
She loves me (one more time)
I said 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not

Sorry I missed your call again, I be in the studio usually
But tomorrow afternoon for me, it'd work beautifully
If your schedule's open, you say, ""That's cool with me
But you stood me up twice, Slim, you're 0-for-2 with me""
'Cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
Well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
Yeah, I'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the D

Lies in my ear, but that's all I wanna hear
It's okay long as we both know this is all it is, whoa
She can have my love for as long as we both are here

Back in my spot now
The music is loud, so I turn the boombox down
We cut off our cell phones
You're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like Balboa
'Cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (whoo)
I put the moves on you like a U-Haul
Bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall to the floor
But canoodlin', I'm not in the mood for
Gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna spoon, doll
But before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
We can f*ck in the closet or in my elevator (uh)
And maybe when it stops and the door opens, we fall out and we just get off on this floor (haha)
You say you're falling for me but not 'cause I'm famous
Then explain to me who that tattoo that's your leg's of?
Girl, your game is an A-plus but you think I don't notice who the screensaver on your damn phone is?
It ain't 'cause who I am, bullshit
I like you, just don't take me for no stupid ass
No disrespect, 'cause even though you're like my truest fan
Know it's clear you only love me 'cause I'm Superman, Lois

Terror con sus amigas
es lo que le gusta
Ella es la reina de su combo y nada la intimida
Es que es la más dura

Solo utiliza Chanel
Qué lo bien lo combina con su joya Cartier
Dicen que su exnovio la dejó por infiel
Le gustan menores como yo, se le ve

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene

I'm not so sure that you can manage this type of entertainment
I've had a Latin boy and truth, there was a bit of damage
Somehow, I think you like that
Let's see if you can last
Forget about the future and we have no past
I like the way you move, you know you're just my type
I guess you like a crazy girl, but it's alright

Mira cómo se mueve, cómo me baila
Cómo me tiene tra-tranquila
Cómo se mueve, cómo me baila y me entretiene, yeah yeah

If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus 
I strangled you to death and I choked you again 
And break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin 
You beef wit' me, I'm even the score equally 
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally 
I get too blunted off the funny home grown 
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono 
So if I said I never did drugs 
That would mean i lie and get fucked more than the President does 
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert 
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet 
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge 
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads 
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les '
Follow me and do exactly what the song says 
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people 
And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal 
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal 
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill 
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill

But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist 
How the f*ck can I be white, I don't even exist 
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave 
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave 
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave 
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave 

Now follow me and do exactly what you see 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D. 
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me 

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole 
When we heard a knock at the door, must of been Ron Gold 
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold 
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco 
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk 
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt 
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer 
That'll spray an Aerosol can up in the ozone layer 
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue 
Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch 
Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on 
And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn 
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits 
A premature birth that was four minutes late 
Mother are you there, I love you 
I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel 
Will someone explain to my brain 
That I just severed a main vein 
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain 
I take a breather and sigh 
Either I'm high, or I'm nuts 
'Cause if you ain't even in this room neither am I 
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass 
Then It's probably obvious that I got it on with her 
'Cause when I drop it off with this solo shit it's over with 
I bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it 

I came to the club drunk with a fake I-D 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I've been with ten women who got H-I-V 
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee 
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me 
I tied a rope around my penis then I jumped from a tree 
You probably want to grow up and be just like me"

I want a diamond, don't give me a fake
I'll let you lick the frosting off my cake
Gimme a spanking, start the day off right (woo-wee)
'Cause it's my birthday, you'll be singing my song tonight

And the beat goes on (na na na na, na na na na na)
I'm a happy girl (na na na na, na na na na na)
It's my birthday song ((na na na na, na na na na na)
In my happy world (na na na na, na na na na na)

I know it's gonna be a good day, oh yeah, today is my birthday

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama"
172,"And I don't think that I can stop it, here it comes
I do my best to try to block it, redrum
I've been sipping on like, vodka, head's numb
I'm blacking out, you better watch it, it's bedlam

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start takin' off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Ferrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beatboxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ay, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks wanna rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
The nigga that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me the enemy watcher
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor, with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers
Spin, grab Denaun's guitar and Honky Tonk ya
All your bars subpar like good golfers
I put a hole in one of you birdies with this Eagle and launch it (pew)

I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil

The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime, I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, bitch, you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic, newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said, ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C)

Hip hop, (hip hop) That's the way of life
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab the pen and pad, and start to jot some
Always told myself, that I would never be losin
Man, I ain't have no hood, my mother was always movin
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn, mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step-dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, then the force got stronger
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is hip hop (hip hop)
Man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi! ""What up?"" Give me a beat box

From the hip hop Shop to Maurice Malone
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore (D12!)
Hell yeah, I looked in my car
Bitch, I was homeless, I slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas had to do what's best, it was a mess
All them taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't by an ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go the car and get them things
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the Beastie Boys
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and the niggas in the club
To the E Dubbs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come

Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did (whoo)
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, and I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff to Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seeger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun, I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryna let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughin' cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thing
I used to have this theory, keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no C-C-W license
I tried to apply for one, they said it take 5-6 months
What the f*ck am I supposed to do meanwhile when rivals come?
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple-platinum, I ain't tryna catch no murder 1
Figured I'd shoot the womb, probably missin' at least one
But the other one's f*ck his shoulder and his knee cap up
And I'm a say for self-defense how come I had the gun
Is because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'll get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to
Havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded
Once I got and I thank God it was empty the night I got caught with it
What the f*ck man, I thought that it was supposed to be

Hip hop, hip hop

Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles of pills
Think your boy is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fuckin' bitch to the curb
But the word, ""Fuckin'"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Hoe thinks her snatch is magical but that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact it'll be nothing to throw that little bitch with a capital B 
Out the back window out the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can't outrap Reynolds
A pad and a pen'll be great but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisible Skratch Piklz

Call me extra, extra (extra) terrestrial (yeah)
Extra, extra, extra terrestrial (skrrt)

Yeah
I could keep beefing, f*ck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in hell but I should get puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said gave you an L, in hell
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growin' up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy!""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head say, ""It's still a dream""
Then he said, ""Kill MCs""
Trippie Redd, with pills on lean
Sippin' meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

447,"I have a tale to tell

I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard
That it sends your body flying across the room
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge, isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world, I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside he loved me

It was a time I suffered so much
I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms, not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain
That was eating me inside, nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and it invades me

I believe we are messengers on earth
I believe in Angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much
To become who I am today

Now you have to realize not only do I have a family
But now I have a whole hood and that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang, I just wanted to fit in

But one day I was forced to do something
That made me open my eyes and realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said you know what to do really, it's time to get poppy for the hood

That was not to kill anybody"
219,"If you tried and failed, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead

What you want is just within your reach
But you got to practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears, and overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

I can, I can't, two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are

Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

Iconic
Iconic
Iconic
Iconic

Tell me I'm no good and I'll be great
Say I have to fight and I can't wait
Standing in the winds, a butterfly that stings
I will rise above 'cause it's my faith

I can, I can't, two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are

Born to be, meant to be

They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

Let's, let's, let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious honey

Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

Traveling, to the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling, leaving logic and reason
Traveling, to the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious

Let's get unconscious

Words are useless, especially sentences
They don't stand for anything
How could they explain how I feel

Traveling, traveling, I'm traveling
Traveling, traveling, leaving logic and reason
Traveling, traveling, I'm gonna relax
Traveling, traveling, in the arms of unconsciousness

Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious

And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious honey
Let's get unconscious

I'll never explain again"
313,"I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back, but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept
my big mouth closed
I could have just done
what I was told
Maybe I should turned silver into gold
But in front of you I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back, but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
But somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I though we were indestructible
I never imagine we could fall
You wanna know how to make a laugh
Telling your plans

We could've bought a house with a swimming pool,
End it up with walls, It would be so cool,
Could've gone by the s in the country sides,
With a back of great things, kissing eye to eye

We could've do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We could've find a mountain in a perfect sun set,
Writing out names across the sky
We could've got a building built in the echo run
We could've got a sales in west and sold out mount
We coulda live like crazy til the days we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
Je suis d'sol'e
I wish I could take you back, but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself

I'm sorry
I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back maybe one day"
52,"Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight up to my best friend

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah

God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it, it's like Clint Eastwood
Looking for peace though, maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I
Get attacked so I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap or
What I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause I'm a sinner
(I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend) Shout it out
Like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival
Your arch enemy surrounds you now he's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's in-piggy-possible to revive you
That's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in the suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script
Cock and I shoot
Who you think's my glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics

To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary 
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out (write it out)
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh (haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't

Just not YouTube, 'cause

That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
F*ck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then

This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*ck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a f*ck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce  and olives
I'll fuckin'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)"
321,"I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back, I know he cannot see
My hands trembling, I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand; at least he was a man

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn?"
238,"Some boys kiss me
Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

Deeper and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter, and sweeter, and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend

You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do"

You were the one
You were my friend
You gave me life
You were the sun
You taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees
I didn't know why
I started to breathe
I wanted to cry

To get a decent job, to have a normal life

They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence, spread everywhere
They say that we need love

456,"The choice was mine, and mine completely
I could have any prize that I desired
I could burn with the splendor of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time

Remember I was very young then
And a year was forever and a day
So what use could fifty, sixty, seventy be?
I saw the lights, and I was on my way

And how I lived, how they shone
But how soon the lights were gone

The choice was yours and noone else's
You can cry for a body in despair
Hang your head because she is no longer there
To shine, to dazzle, or betray
How she lived, how she shone
But how soon the lights were gone

Eyes, hair, face, image
All must be preserved
Still life displayed forever
No less than she deserved."

Okay
I got the album from upstairs
And
And this is by far, the most,

Incredible thing, I've ever heard"
5,"Yeah, yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts 
And see where this takes me, 
'Cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinking 'bout no bank account
But bitch I'm off the chain like Taylor Brown
Motherfucker, shut the f*ck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the f*ck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause 
I just don't get what the f*ck half the shit is that you're listening to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil' Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna f*ck on my bitch? 
(F*ck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll just turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the f*ck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks
And now he wants to take it out on us?"" (Ooh-ooh)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'Zae
Lil' Pump, Lil' Xan imitate Lil' Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the f*ck are you gonna do? Where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached, my enemies die
I don't ceasefire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date,"" ""Looks like an olive to me.""
""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang, Burger King, Gucci Gang, Mookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"

Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think,
That makes me gonzo.
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas,
Someone get me a bed in the ""Casa de Loco"" for all my mananas,
For I'm going bananas.
Yes, I'm going bananas.
Si, I'm going bananas."

That it can put you in the mood to jump outta ya car while it's movin
You've been waitin on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen, I'm servin, I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book go head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage ya find somethin
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin
I'm constantly coppin over you, squatin, shit is gotten
To the point, where I'm ain't even writin no more I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickin, I've been kickin ass off bullshit, throw away rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap
You crazy? I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat
You Canibus? then it's Dre's beat
You Kay Slay? the fee's waived

31,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's coming home with his next grasp to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress less, mismatch
On his breast jackets is sex addict
And cheaters want to egg sack it for being checked, get back
It's a chest match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't f*ck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knifing hands, says the relationship hanging by a strip
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to Spiderman
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said ""Bye Suzanne"" after the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
A little one, I don't want to admit to something

One night stand turned into night stayin'
It was cold, some lights gram
Y'all be hung tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did adverse to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous and suited
When it's too hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in cursin' to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just still like the person who I'm turnin' into
Irreversible, I pray for you like a church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soap box and breach, my sermon in speech
Detergent and bleach is burned in the womb
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this bullshit in new
To use protection 'fore I pity to your forbidden crew, f*ck

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

Denver, never run
Call me (ooh)
Call me (ooh)
River (ooh)
We'll let the river run

Always the bride's maid, never ""The bride, hey!""
What can I say? If life was a highway
The sequels are non-clay
But be swerving in side lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice maybe
That's why I'm made, that came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight, what I made you
Terminate my baby
This love triangle, left us in a rectangle
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
That I really woulda' loved your smile
Didn't really want to abort
But f*ck it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

I’m at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That’s what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can’t be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body’s awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I’m popular, but

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love
You know this ain’t love (What is it then?) It’s desperation

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I’m in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don’t see nothin' but you
And I’m about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can’t do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can’t, specifically to describe it
I just can’t seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout “I live and breathe you”
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don’t wanna be without you, don’t wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it’s both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain’t

You know this ain’t love
Oh no, no this ain’t love

She’s lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It’s desperation)
I can’t even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her (And here I go again)

Just want you to myself, don’t wanna share you with no one else
What the f*ck you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it’s time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain’t the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That’s a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany’s
You better have an epiphany"

Kids sipping Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivating
Ain't nobody graduating
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm getting aggravated, f*ck, I'm getting agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fucking schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the f*ck is going on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fucking Matrix

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem
I was this good, scoffed, I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
No one really gave a f*ck about my descent, 'till I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the (Doctor's orders)
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do alls
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fucking goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm going in, already got an arm and head
And whoever said word are just words
Can't hurt me more than I give a f*ck
Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned
In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like
They didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse, it's worth it
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toeing a line to overtime
As sure as I'm always lying, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'mma go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
I'm starting to slow and these lines are my nines
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign, been a (Doctor's)
Assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, set with the blasters, give me the orders, I spray uh
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waiting on someone to say something
Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run for old time's sake
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waiting for has come but

What I did, it's nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They hollerin', ""Shady""

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch but I was grateful to trade that shit for the trailer with the hitch
Thought it would made me a ravin' lunatic
But I made it through to my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
Now I'm just paradin', you would still get Shady 'til I'm eighty two

Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose

I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flop, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on their grind, makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you water down
You gotta take shots with 100 proof

Check that
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have the savage within
Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an MC
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti
Would be like remedial readin' to me (yeah)
'Til my last breath leave my lungs, I'ma beat my drums (yeah)
For the streets I'm from (yeah)
The east side slums (yeah)
Gotta remind 'em (yeah)
I take a foe out (yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (what), you see my thumb (what?)
You see my fist, f*ck a peach pipe bum (what?)
For the smoke but it's not the weed I want (what?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I come (woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm off kickin' feet in the recliner
And I think I'm up
'Bout to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been
(For the last time, man)
Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
Really I have no idea
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been"
20,"I got a song filled with shit for the strong willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off 'till you
Scream, piss off, screw you
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like

Knock knock, let the devil in, malevolent
As I've ever been, head is spinnin' and this medicine
Screaming, ""L-l-l-let us in""
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allen Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Hell, I meant Kahlúa, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerants and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, medal win
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor of the, motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to mailmen
And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care, I
Barely could wait to hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pin
Cocked, f*ck around and catch a hot one
I-i-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thought spun like your web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, f*ck a blood track
Like, what's her name at the wheel?
Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, end up crashin'
Into ya, look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the f*ck's happened

On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so

You're snake-bitten with my

Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, double-aught, Buckshot
Tied her up to a garrote
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the f*ck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me

About you or the stuff you're working on?

It's, it's like, what's next? Kamikaze 2
The album where you reply to everybody who didn't like the album that you made

I leak words that’s controversial

That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up

I wouldn’t say “fuckin’” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on!

So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin’ these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I’m stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she’s on?

And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16’s and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint’s speech to fix these streets?!

He was only twenty three
Gone before he had his time

He knew the day was dawning

In this life I loved you most of all

What for?

What for?
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
'Cause now you're gone and I have to ask myself

Who determines, who knows best

Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me

Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a f*ck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

F*ck it, let’s all stand up!"
195,"And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

[Chorus:]
Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah
Step to the beat
Boy what will it be

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Bridge:

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

[Chorus:]

Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes

(bridge)
(chorus)

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I now you're mine

You've got to

(chorus lyrics)

Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine, now I know you're mine
You've got to..."

Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touched
Trust me, ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buck shots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops (pow)
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold ya
Motherfuck a soldier ready to roll or take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct (pin, explosion)
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' 'cause there's no stoppin' 'til they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon (boom)
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
F*ck bein' trapped, I'm a soldier

I betcha that's how I got some things you ain't got
That's called courage, and it don't come
From no flick or bottle, it ain't scotch
It's not bourbon, I don't walk around
Like no G 'cause that ain't me
I'm not that person, I don't try
To act like you do 'cause that ain't you
You just burpin', you ain't

2Pac in the mad bitch
In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the back seat nigga when we clown
Homey is you down? D got the strap and she anxious (click)
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit (tires peeling)
Comin' 'round the corner spittin' rounds, they can't hold me down
Caught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day stinkin' beotch!

I betcha that's how I got some things you ain't got
That's called courage, and it don't come

Ooh, I say a line, people are outraged (oh no)
The press slams me again (yeah), the people aren't having it nowadays
Give an album that I put out in like 2000 you griped about praise
But I wake up everyday even more caked up than the makeup on your clown face
And I lay my foundation

I told my dawgs we gon' get right in they ear, yeah
Wouldn't call, now dip, gone in the Lear, yeah
Still have all these demons comin' for my neck, yeah, yeah

What rhymes with Pariah? (I don't know)
Mm, uh, LEGO? (Oh shit)

It's like your bitch's midriff, shit gets my dick stiff as a stickshift
Dick as in Cheney, drip as in saline
They bring my name up just to get ratings

Rappin' circle around these ho's

There's a fuckin' circus in town, yeah bitch, this verse finna clown ICP
R. Kelly sex tape, I see pee (whoa)

317,"Je suis prete. Est-ce que vous etes pret, aussi?

Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Oh no baby my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time, are you just being kind
Don't go givin' me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run seem to have all the fun
But are you wasting my time -- she's so fine
Are you just being kind

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
That's how I feel, don't fog my mind

Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
That this is not a love song that I want to sing"
427,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"
101,"One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the f*ck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
F*ck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
F*ck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya"

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey

As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

Something may be broken
Still, you love her

For me, it's just usual

(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
Once I get going I am gone
(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
I'll keep it going all night long

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one)
That the light shines on

This complicated life
I try to do my best
I always tell myself
It's all just a test
For me it's an escape
'Cause dancing makes me feel beautiful

(And I can't pretend, it should never end, let the music play, are you watching now?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(You can really pop it now, it should never end, let the music play, cause I'm here to stay)
I'll keep on dancing through the night

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one)
That the light shines on

See my booty get down like,
See my booty get down like,
See my booty get down like,
See my booty get down like,

See my booty get down like

You probably think I'm crazy
I don't want you to save me
Don't mean to disappoint you
I've never felt so free
If you could stand in my shoes
Then you would feel my heartbeat too

(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(You can really pop it now, drop it now, ain't no stopping now, are you watching now?)
I can keep on going through the night

You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know, can't you see
When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see?
When I dance, I feel free

People of Europe, I send you the Rainbow of Argentina
(Che:)
Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much
(Aide #1:)
She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
(Aide #2:)
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
(Che:)
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard
(Aide #1:)
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
(Aide #2:)
But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card
Chorus:
(Peron and Aides:)
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is yes
(Peron:)
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?
(Che:)
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why
(Eva:)
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!
(Italian admiral:)
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
(Aide #2:)
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
(Che:)
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
(Aide #1:)
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye
(chorus)
(Peron:) Will Evita win through?
(Aides:) But the answer is ...
(Che:) A qualified
(Aides:) Yes
(Che:)
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
(Che:)
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now
(Aide #1:)
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow
(Che:)
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required
(chorus)
(Aide #2:) Would Evita win through?
(Aide #1:) And the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) And no
(Aides:) And yes
(Che:) No
(chorus)
(Aides:) Would Evita win through? But the answer is
(Aide #2:) Yes
(Aide #1:) Yes
(Aide #2:) Yes"

103,"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare (A nightmare, a nightmare, a nightmare)

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
""I remember it clearly, even today""
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, F*ck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

(They shall not escape my vengeance)

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont (quit)

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey"

You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune

You sad I was over wanted it to end
Than you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak city
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty

You and baby and older and making me say things
I did it, yay me, and be, it just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentle, men let's strip away everything
And see the main reason that I, feel like a lame piece of shit

Complain beef and bicker about the same things

And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

[Chorus]
Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak 'cause you gotta 'long the street
They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been mislead by the things you've said

When you're living on the street
Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home

You can do it, uh huh

You can do it

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold

You better think twice when you cross the ice
Everything you do comes back to you
When you're shedding a tear sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right

What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

[Chorus:]

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

[Chorus:]

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

188,"Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there, just like a prayer"
356,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog

Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the f*ck off
I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'

I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia

Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfuckin' ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour

I'm looking at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
And you can get the fickity-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, eatin' spaghetti again
Got a 6 o'clock craving, stop, get Ciroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you, pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then, let's lip-lock
If not then, chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit

So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'mma keep on saying
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't
Do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will
They saying I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping till be sprayed it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking
What's it called again? I'm blanking
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think
I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis
chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it
quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the f*ck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me

In 7 nights in the days and it's our Vegas
We rolling circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down did an ALS challenge, huh
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the f*ck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said saint, por favor
Thought I said to wait, had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas

(Ha, yeah), yeah, and I don't do that sing-song bitch shit
And I don't use autotune, all I do is spit, and this shit just bothers you
Call it quits bitch, impossible
My pen just popped your thought-balloon, you dipshits know how I'ma do it
Send a motherfucking beat to the trauma-unit, yeah, Shady Records
Look at all these squad killers we brought with us
Juggernauts and Godzillas, you don't rock with us you're off of your rockers
Bitch, backs to the wall
Is it always, is why I'm not talkin' about wallets and knots
When I say that the wall it is not against
It's more like the cross
Look at how far this is past you
Regardless you want me to reach a fuckin' bar that does not exist
No pun intended, but GRIP, hold on to this moment
'Cause soon as you reach the top, they're gon' want you to fall from it
So you better grab your seatbelt
Like I did mine, and fasten yours
Like a motherfucking plane-crash passenger
'Cause one day you'll be crashing back to earth
And if you don't ever stop to smell the roses
I do know one thing, that's for sure
You don't get your flowers 'til you pushin' up daisies
And that's about all your ashes earn

Back to the wall and they all against me
Level my mind, but there's cash to earn
I was hopin' maybe we could ball eventually
If only one time 'fore we crash and burn
Pulling from the script but the sides are empty
'Cause you chose rap as your favorite girl
Could've fooled me, can't save the world
Could've fooled me, can't save the world

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

In Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit

I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis

I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud, ""All of y'all, get the hell out now""
F*ck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage

So I told 'em I was Mike D, they was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'til I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

Let's pretend like its '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes

I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky

I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes

Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win

303,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, you know, what's crackin', Dre?

Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits
'Til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(Watch out, nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw
Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I

Somehow, some way
Hello nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up
And show 'em where the f*ck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns
And I love all of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was?
Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up Slim)
(What up, Cuz? What up, Snoop!)
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast
Baby

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage
With ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat

Aww, naww, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, (What?) dick six inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (a .44)

And you don't really wanna f*ck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
F*ck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

34,"We never saw from each other's sides
Or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news
Love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun
Actually used to run
Back to the booth
Jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue
Lash out on you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb
Stone it was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once
And that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because

How come you can be a low illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailey
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod
When my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks
In that tiny box
When we tied the knot
When we broke the knot
Every line we crossed
We were supposed to not
Every time we fought
Being souls they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we could've read
Which maybe would've lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I said I wasn't sitting here asking myself

How come you can be a low illusion
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
There's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Till we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now
And all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us to not hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard mockingbird
And got the urge to jot me some verses
And thoughts the purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused a few, and so have you
Or argue who's fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine
But really no ones, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh f*ck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We was so nuts, back stab each other, another blow struck
But there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over
And it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people could be so good at one thing 
And so fucked at a whole 'nother shit it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes
I reply
There's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"

Surf's the sky for a place to call home
I woke up with my head in the fire
Get my kicks when I'm walking the wire

Ah, o-wo-o-ho
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho
I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Ah, o-wo-o-ho
Ah, wo-o-ho-ho

Wanna be like us tonight
All the boys, all the boys and girls
Ride the magic bus tonight

I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner,
Praise the lord and I like it that way

Hail Mary, full of grace
Get down on your knees and pray
Jesus Christ, hanging on the cross
Died for our sins, it's such a loss
Saint Christopher, find my way
I'll be coming home one day
Saint Sebastian, don't you cry
Let those poison arrows fly

Saint Anthony, lost and found
Thomas a cryin', just stand your ground
All those saints and holy men
Catch me before I sin again

Oh-o-wo-ho

I'm a sinner, I like it that way
Oh-o-wo-ho

227,"Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing

It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem

Mic check, one two
(I never knew I)
Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I)
Who'da known?
(I never knew I)

F*ck, what a story
(I never knew I)
Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I)
And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk, when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the f*ck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn 'em around

Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
F*ck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
But don't blame me, when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screamin, ""Go"", with their seventeen year old uncle
I'm like, ""Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked, if they liked violence?""

And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow, your twelve year old daughter to wear?
So tell me, that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
And 'F*ck' was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird

So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch, I never knew I'd

Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
F*ck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees
How many retards'll listen to me?
And run up in the school shootin'
When they're pissed at a teach

Her, him, is it you, is it them?
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought?
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist

27,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so f*ck him and f*ck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a f*ck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Con mi corazón, 
Cariño no me lastimes 
Cuidado (please be careful) 
Es mi corazón 
Mi corazón 

If I could reach out to you
Nothing will stop me 
Take your head in my hands
Tell me what would you do 
Kiss your eyes, sing you to sleep
Your voice sounds like a lullaby 
Here's my heart, this time to keep
Here's my heart to keep"
467,"When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
(I'm addicted to your love)
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It's like MDNA and that's OK

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm ready to take this chance
I need to dance

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)
MDNA, MDNA, MDNA, MDNA (I'm addicted)"
368,"Am I just dreaming or did you walk through my door?
Do you still feel the same way that you did before?
Did you come to bring me sorrow?
Like all those wasted days
Let's not think about tomorrow

You can stay
Am I just dreaming or did you say you have to go?
If you can't stay forever, I don't want to know
There's no need to talk about it
The way things used to be
I'm not living here without you

Won't you stay, stay darlin'
You could stay, stay darlin'
Won't you stay, stay darlin'

Um

No, I don't plan to reply to everybody who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like
What people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And, uh
Yo, this Yahoo mother fucker, whatever the f*ck his name is
Said I, literally said I rhymed ""rhymes"" with ""chimes""
""Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes""
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid

And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now

Don't have a choice cause the temperatures pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you

I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun it it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

You make me want to hang my head down and cry

For something I want don't try to resist me

I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way

Waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead

I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
Killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mamas
And I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus
'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats
I'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more

Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador

Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too

You are the day, I am the night
Leave you a blanket of silver and gold
I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told

I need your strength, it will keep me from harm
I'll be your queen, safe in your arms
Don't want to get to the end of my days
Saying I wasn't amazed

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey

I let her chop my balls off, too 'fore I lost to you, Nick
I should quit watchin' news clips, yeah
My balls are too big, I should be talkin' pool
'Cause I got scratch, so my pockets full when I'm takin' shots at you
F*ck it, lemme chalk the cue stick
I'm over the top, like Cool Whip
And I promise you the day I fall off or lose it
I will stop and cut off the music
Opportunist, wanna kill shit every chance that I got to do this
Stackin' my guap, savage, I'm not
To fool with, like a handgun, you could say I'm like a gat when it's cocked
I keep it a (buck, buck), your ass'll get shot
If rap was an actual Glock, you'd act like you're strapped when you're not
Only cap that you pop is the top on the can of your pop
You the man 'til I pop your top
You ain't Jack in a Box
And I ain't talkin' a hamburger spot
Cracker with the barrel, armed to the teeth, Anderson .Paak (yeah)
Rest in peace to Afeni and her son Pac
You sent me that plaque with his rhyme sheet, I haven't forgot (nah)
Blow 30 million in a month, call it Brewster's Millions
Just hope I don't lose the feelin', from soldier to civilian
Got everything I need but I don't even see myself in the future chillin'
Only thing I don't have in the booth's a ceiling, just call me the roofless villain
They tellin' me sky's the limit, so I got my head in the clouds
Unicorn in human form, saw a gift horse, looked him dead in the mouth
(And Lord) And Lord, good lookin' out, for sendin' me Edna and Charles
Whenever mom kicked me out of the house
They were the bomb, then you sent me L-L
All the times that I hated myself, since eleven or twelve
Only way that I knew how to better myself is when I'm bet against by everyone else
So Joe hit the head on the nail
You ain't seen God 'til you starin' down a barrel
I was gun shy, but now like a snail
The slug's comin' out of its shell

Oh, there's no hate in this world
That can make me give up
That can keep me stuck
Lord, I thank you (Lord, I thank you)
I thank you, I'm so grateful, so thankful, so thankful (so thankful)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, mm
I thank the Lord above
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo"

Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it
Then you let it go
See you tried to call me, but I blocked you on the phone

It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you say it that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

I know you'd like it if I stayed home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded you were never on the side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, did it, loved it, hated it
I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored?

Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)

I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the f*ck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink malt liquor to f*ck you up quicker

In his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee

Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron

Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra

Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes

Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
Ooh you're an angel
In disguise
I can see it in your eyes

You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel baby

Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip

Your jaw starts grinnin', and this is the beginnin'

Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (so what did you do)
I took 'er to my place (yo, did she sit on your face)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop

In the same order as ya hear, boy I'm not frontin'
Me not front, don't ask what, me tell ya the truth, you understand me eye?

Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle

I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different 'fros
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turnin' up my stereo

But when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickenson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture, then ripped it in half
And whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan

2,"Yeah, I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin'"", like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack one and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey

I can still remember (what), tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (yeah)
became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (what) if I'd prevail (huh)
And all I did was (what) put Nine Inch Nails (where)
In my eyelids now (what), I'm seein' diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means, if rap was skinny jeans
I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splittin' seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means no if, ands, or buts, are squeezin' in-between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fucking living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me
I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean (ow!)
Shinin' wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, that shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king, bring me fifty bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to get super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

This a song about
My, my stepdad
Let's see if this ever happened to you
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures that I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I cried
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I just wish I could jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection and put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium ion
Then mom and him let bygones, just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this why I

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry, which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes ""Whoops"" and just laughs
I yelled for mom (mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""F*ck you punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter wein
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin'
""Bye-bye stepdad"" (stepdad)"

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
Uhhh, hahahahha 
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess I'll die another day 
Another day
Another day 
Another day 
Another day 
Another day 
Another day 
Another day"
254,"A million miles later
We walk through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised but our hearts will guide us
Together I know no one else is gonna last forever
You're gonna be alright, tonight

We live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane

Together, we're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Like stars, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna

129,"Before I check the mic (check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (yeah) give zero fucks, then I (yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then I (yeah)
Check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising every time I drop
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do, it's see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack, but always get attacked (yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like snores, but odds like that with these thoughts I have's
Like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands

Shit, hold on, man
Motherfucker
Happy birthday to
F*ck (shh, quiet)

I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

What the f*ck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

So until the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (yeah), D.R.E and me (yup)
From the MMLP to MTBMB (bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (haha)
So call me Santa Clause (Santa Clause)
'Cause at the present (yeah), I out-rap 'em all, I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (uh)
Through a plastic straw (yeah) with a fractured jaw (damn)
My dick is coat check (ha), she wanna jack it off (yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car, get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the f*ck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (damn)
And this the final chapter, 'cause I'm either frying after
Or they gon' give me the needle (what) like a vinyl scratcher
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite like a tree mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (bark, bark, bar king)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (why) ball hard (ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bar's were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (nah)
So you'd be a fitted (yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee on your head, like a Phillies hat (haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you'd probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna f*ck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all'll get cut the f*ck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole

Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
F*ck it"
261,"I can give you everything that you want
You can't buy this in a luxury store
There's aplace you have to go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug
It should be illegal

Baby you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty 
I think you need it

Kiss it 
Kiss it back
Doesn't it taste like holy water?
Doesn't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it back
Make it wet
Doesn't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better
Kiss it better

I can teach all the things you don't know
It's rare like making something you wanna own
Bitch get out my poem
Bitch get out my poem

There's something you got to hear
It's secret and immaculate
I can let you in Heaven's door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation right within
We can do it here on the floor

Kiss it 
Kiss it back
Doesn't it taste like holy water?

263,"In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert
An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this crazy ex where has stand where I fall

I don't lie, not trying to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Jump between the impulses, 
Stay or running away from all this madness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like a tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me

All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You can fled a needle with the cheer of from my eyes
It should injustice to be with this, two of things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me

From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like a tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me"
7,"Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
F*ck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
F*ck you too, woah!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't f*ck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not f*ck with you guys
If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangin'
Some chains and some blades in and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just drop four like an Uno
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto
Lookin' for something that prolly can never find out
Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now
What you would nigga? You really want me tied down
I've been alone, I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower

I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
F*ck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, f*ck the rules
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
F*ck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me ""What the f*ck happened to hip-hop?""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And f*ck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps, let's recap
Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks
Eight DATs with the G raps and Kane's hat
We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
That you're a button to press or a lever to pull
They give me the snap though (lil' bitch)
And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big
But you've been takin' the dicks
In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink, any minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'ma sleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat, I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker never got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ay
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour
And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a writer might've fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"

Profitin' off of coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me

Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me

Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talkin' reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged
Ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (yeah)
Was a have-not (yeah) 'cause my pockets (uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get colder, began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let 'em treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the Doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""F*ck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo

I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' f*ck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat

How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
I'm diplomatic 'cause I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, dog, you was like a (yeah) damn God to me
Man, not really (haha)
I had ""dog"" backwards
But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me
Shit, it's no wonder

I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, ""You ain't the G.O.A.T."", I come down like, ""Ooh""
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I could see the game from a bird's-eye view (ayy)
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god (ayy)
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta (ayy)
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around like they don't love you"
179,"They ask me am I ok, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy
And..."
155,"Yeah (oh)
This game is like cocaine
I want this more than anything in the world
Haha, so do I, at least I thought I did
Got to have it, yeah, I ma..."
38,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shotty entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'""
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
But 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald
Shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her
While I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the Xanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll, a Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled, (Em) so's my manager
Bitch I'm amateur, f*ck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push in to kaputt you when I
Pull 'em like, sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
And I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a 10, you're an 8
Like what I do before, after, and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' out with my degrees
It's the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like lodi partner, blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get to soakin', try to get to poke the hole in
While you hose me off, and nope I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
I got a lotta more
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head, I never hunted for the bread
And what I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply
Because, I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I pray when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds"

Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive

I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady with rabies

I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school, ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, it's a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?

Hit 'em with that (doot, doot, doot) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place, but if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked, you gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like Jay-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed now, chicka-chicka-chicka, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered

Hold up, I said Rover because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (roof) like the doberman said
I still think the (roof) would go over your head (haha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit with so many foul lines
You think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best? I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though, 'cause MC's know

But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
And you're trapped in your cell phone
On my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't want to fuckin' listen to you spit your rap someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mil'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular f*ck, like f*ck rap

I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With the Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug it, fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare knuckle it, nah, f*ck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket, abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, f*ck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while you panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagan's, tryin' to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this stand up banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floor boards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins, lapkins and chapki
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm papkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flammina babbita playin' a jampkin

42,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark’s high
Butterflies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
’til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, ""this shit is garbage""
God’s given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the ""Speedom"" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the f*ck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a f*ck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

I'm just living in chaos
Gotta get away from here

Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control
Where's the party, I want to free my soul
Where's the party, I want to lose control

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how, I'm ready now

Slow down you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now
(repeat)

Where's the party
Where's the party, someone tell me
Where's the party, come on, come on, come on
Where's the party

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last

We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)

I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to, feeling like the streets need me (woah)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spider move, like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
If the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We can not give a f*ck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya, it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants

You say you're affiliated with murderers, killers (ayy)
The people you run with are thuggin' (gang)
But you're just a wanna be gunner (gang)
Like you was gonna do something
Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged in to nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, in other words if you're a Gunner
Roll up with your (gang)
You're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and f*ck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feeling himself
He wants to keep up
His tough demeanor, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne 
If you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you but you already know who the f*ck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as f*ck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories, jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, rarely but this time Shady 
'Bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer on this little non-threatening blond fairy
Cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and I told him 
The moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein, a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is Groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Rolex to Goldman and I'm throat-sprayin' tryna throw to Nicole
They both hate to choke and my whole plate is chokin'
And I double-edge sworded 'cause one place 
I poke and I stick and I turn and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle 
Of sick individuals, take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formidable, that you're bitches are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nuttin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One month older
Sponge, mob, colder
Nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster
Lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic, when we're on it (yeah)

140,"Yeah
So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
My joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the f*ck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or the Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (yeah)
I'm L. L. Cool J, bigger and deffer, that's how come (uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (what?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by"

My flow all over the place, .44 in the waist
I'm so-so innovative, po-po went away, I roll over 'em and make bacon
And call 'em a pig, won't you hop up off of my dick?
Words in the way, I'm at lost by 'em

I'm in the Slick Rick eyepatch, but I got it from Hex
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
For the God in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
They be like, ""You put the Thought on? Yikes""
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I'm the king of the blood sport, all mice
I'm from an era, you had beef? Y'all prolly fist fought on sight
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-ilitants
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm Coke buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars just like ASMR
All my dogs is at the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call my youngins takin' flight
You a bark, bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo

Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmost the Third, with seven inch herringbones

They call me five to nine, and thought duh-dun, duh-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out, like the Octo-Mom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist, tryna ball a fist I will
F*ck you just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant

When did your name change from language to magic?
I’d write it again on the back of my hand,

Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I’m ready to take this chance
I need to dance

I'm about taking a risk, that might f*ck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (brrr)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like ""niggas took the flow but I'm still standing too""
Thought I had the Midas touch
And then I went platinum too
Mother f*ck all your comparisons
I've been talking to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America
I ain't inherit shit but a millionaire under 30
So He must be hearing shit
Don, don, don, life, I do this for the crib
The D to Flint who get sick with lead
Others get the hit with the laugh
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I have is from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
So you know where I came from
Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Wood grain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses till you bitches start acknowledging
The pictures we been painting, my nigga
Connected to a higher power
How I know? 'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stopping like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise, be the G.O.A.T.
While we alive when we die, we gon' be the gods

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others low key with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors

If she was flavor I won't savor
No taste buds, hoe later
F*ck you looking at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fucking ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time late means I'm early, my age is reversing
I'm basically 30, amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringe worthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving
Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fucking Terrier hittin' it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul shoot off at the fucking mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And f*ck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Drumpf's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A., white Bronco like Elway
Speeding, I'm bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beatin ‘em, bet you they'll lay bleeding
And yell, ""Wait!"", pleading—but screaming is pointless
Like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cell mate
See me I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
Cause I'ma—

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from em, no favors
Clique too big, bread? gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snaking faking
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em?
No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the taking
And what I need from 'em? no favors

What are you doing here?"
59,"What is life? 
Life is like a big obstacle 
In front of your optical to slow you down 

And every time you think you gotten past it 
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground 
What are friends? 
Friends are people that you think are your friends 
But they really your enemies, with secret identities 
And disguises, to hide they true colors 
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers 
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin' 

What is money? 
Money is what makes a man act funny 
Money is the root of all evil 
Money'll make them same friends come back around 
Swearing that they was always down 

What is life? 
I'm tired of life 
I'm tired of backstabbing a** snakes with friendly grins 
I'm tired of committing so many sins 
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins 
Tired of never having any ends 
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things 
I'm tired of this DJ playing your s*** when he spins 
Tired of not having a deal 
Tired of having to deal with the bulls*** without grabbing the steel 
Tired of drowning in my sorrow 
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo 
I'm tired of motherf***ers spraying s*** and dartin' off 
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour 
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off 
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough 
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk 
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk 
I'm tired of using plastic silverware 
Tired of working in Building Square 
Tired of not being a millionaire 
But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 

If I had a magic wand, 
I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, 
While I'm on the john 
If I had a million bucks 
It wouldn't be enough, 
Because I'd still be out 
Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish 
I would ask for a big enough a** 
For the whole world to kiss 

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor 
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store 
I'm tired of not having a phone 
Tired of not having a home 
To have one in if I did have it on 
Tired of not driving a B-M 
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him 
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M 
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum 
Tired of not being on tour 
Tired of f***ing the same blond whore 
After work in the back of a Contour 
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones 
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns 

Tired of being stared at 
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat 
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz 
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs 
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me 
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me 
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs 
Tired of J-L-be	 saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives"" 

But if I had a million dollars 
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics 
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick 
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john 

If I had a million bucks

Robbing armored trucks 
If I had one wish

You know what I'm saying? 
I'm tired of all of this bulls*** 
Telling me to be positive 
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see s*** positive? 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
I rap about s*** around me, s*** I see 
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Right now I'm tired of everything 
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city 
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'? 
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Just fed up 
That's my word"
83,"So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin' pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the f*ck outta everything I come across in the halls

I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
Bitch it's too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, 380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators

My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, forgive me

I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, brigade laced it
You hidin' I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink kahlua and gin throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the million man March we gon' fight

'Cause I don't give a f*ck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron

I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)

I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin' nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a stop the violence rally, I blast gats

Be your mom on publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Want your motherfuckin' pockets,ascap
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's

Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get their jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin more violence than nine hoodlums

I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a luni
I got a yuk mouth and it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it

I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys

If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo
I leave ya face leakin' run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order

I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named fall out von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run

Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a f*ck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck my dick

Suck my motherfuckin dick, D-12 dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid, swifty McVeigh, The Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady"

Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

Quicker than a ray of light
Then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe

133,"Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (yeah)

Five dozen, flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (what?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""F*ck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til its so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the f*ck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?

I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get revenge and (what?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing I vow to smother and beat them
A God but a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where are you going?

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the real dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the f*ck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only gut you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade up, and then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

I'm leaving Heaven (yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (you know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
Where are you going? (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (f*ck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (you know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where are you going? (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me)

So you better, you better run (yeah)
You better, you better run (so I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (cocksucker)
You better, you better run (see you in Hell)"

Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch

No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die

But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show""

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet"

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word get closer to the fire

Her heart is on the street, tu corazon es suyo

Uh, you weren't with me on the cold block nights
Now you front row for the spotlight
Now the diamonds in the Audemars bright
Jets overseas for a far flight
Young nigga on bullshit and I ball on 'em, Bill Cartwright
Knew I could shine through the darkness
I guess I always been a star type
That lion in me made my heart fight, could've been a victim of an opp pipe
Took a million risks just to get to this 'cause we ain't the ones that the cops like
Been so many times God tested me, they only see the answers I got right
They commentin' all on the blogs, tryna tell me how to live my life
And I waited so patiently, if you could take off, don't wait for me
No days off, grind faithfully, I keep thankin' God for savin' me
Front line, showcasin' our bravery
I know that top spot, it was made for me
It all paid off so we felt the struggle so painfully

Never mind all the ice cubes on this wristwear in the big body
Live by the gun, get bodied or it's hella time in that cell
It was hella times where I failed, when I had to double back from them Ls
Bet he don't double back when he tell
'Cause it ain't no comin' back when you tell
Why would you leave me here by myself? A nigga be lonely
Ayy, I blew the whole bag on they flights, ain't leavin' the homies
If he really gang, then get him a chain, no cubic zirconies
White Zomb' in the stogey, stood firm, never folded
Furthest thing from a rodent, you put the jacket on and you bogus
Yeah, big dawg and they know it
I had to spin off to stay focused
Longev' on the motion
We don't abandon ship when it's hopeless
I done been broke before and they know

I make it look easy

I make it look easy

And all of the nightmares (nightmares)

Got all (what?), this bread (yeah)
I'm still (what?), sour though (huh)
I don't know (I'm a), square peg (in a), round hole (yeah)
Like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
Rocky Balboa (I), never been no (what?), towel thrower
Even when I got kicked to the curb (yeah)
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment and hurt
To an unquenchable thirst, in the simplest terms
It's revenge of the nerd, in every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength and resilience (nah)
How I rack my brain but it feels as if I'm tryna explain it to children (damn)
So a lot of this pain isn't healin', no escapin' it, this anger is spilling
Almost like recreatin' a feelin' of 9/11 when the second plane hit the building
So let 'em paint you the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom (yeah)
Of havin' way too much income (mmm)
But when you struggled every day just to get some (yeah)
Now all of this hate is a syndrome (yuh)
When they can't relate, and that stems from (what?)
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green but those aren't leaves (leaves)
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and pray
Had to claw, scratch and fight my way
Just follow me, and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey (Skylar Grey)
And rappers, how can we be on the same level now
When I gotta look down and see these clowns that are on the ground?
Bitch, I got clouds beneath me
Ever since I put out the EP to the height of 2003 me
You ain't see the struggle to make it out the D
Because I made it somehow look easy

Now you see me standin' in the lights

Hearing my father say ""told you so, told you so""
Why can't you be like the other girls
I said, oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever me
Thought I'd belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, oh no, I don't want it more
That's not what I'm looking for

So I took the road-less
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Deep down in the dust of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative
I said oh yeah, that was me
All of the things I did, just to be seen"
376,"In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess
Will I still be thirsty
Will I pass the test
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
'Cause I'm not supposed to see
'Cause the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
'Cause after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
'Cause the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
It's in my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in fountain blue
Lies my secret garden"

In time (everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this

Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound

Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds

And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (haha)
F*ck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw

No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits

13,"It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof, wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do so I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on they own and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel, and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is clear

If I could leave this world behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Bacardi in hand, never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift, all the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words

But I guess they're just honored for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to but I'm fighting for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm under the sink, but it was not my intent

To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road, done all we possibly can
I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt

To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, f*ck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk 'bout you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim (shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!)
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit just clownin', dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (woo)
Tin brain, probably fucked in the membrane
Slim Shade, minds in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame

All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the killshot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt
Should've never made a response to the disdain for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an ant hill

What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen
He used to rap like the people his music was for
He was exactly like them
The dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?
Can't use that excuse anymore
He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war
With a clown he's yelling ""At it again""
I talk to your mother, she told me she love me
All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me
Wants nobody but me, she showed me the duggy
Can I get a witness like notary public?
She said kicks some fly shit (fly shit)
I said I got wings on my ass (wings on my ass)
Told her my dick's a cockpit (dick's a cockpit)
I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)
Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded

Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (meal's gonna come from)
Now I just wonder (now I just wonder) where my next mil's gonna come from

I get to remind all the haters, who shitted on me when I'm on my way up
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
I will swear on a stack of Bibles
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols
I don't care, it's Music To Be Murdered By
So Bon Iver can swallow a fucking Ja Rule bobblehead
Then die slow like Alzheimer's (haha)
Low sniper, I hold the micro-phone like a loaded rifle

I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad
But gift of gab and pen to pad
Turn temper tantrums into anthems
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks
Spit your damnedest, you're still gonna hit the canvas
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
Then the amygdala hippocampus
Is gonna trigger the ingoramus
To think of the most ridiculous shit then spit
Then pin it against these pitiful rappers
Insidious, these idiots witty as shit, against me, shitty as MC Hammers
Get your whole squad, send the task force in
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for
Then put your helmet on, strap your chin
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
Or to go against, f*ck would you wanna do that for?
No offense, but are you retard, slow or dense?
A fuckin' penny has more sense
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal
But every thought is so ill and so methodical
Thought I swallowed a pill, I'm startin' to feel like I'm an automobile
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snotty articles
And that explains why the f*ck you clowns are all in my grill
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame
Choice I made, swore someday
The world'll pay, less to lose, more to gain
Daughter's raised, yesterday, glory days, adored and praised
Ignore the hate, address the fake
Toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came
Destroyed the game, before you came, enjoy your stay
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim
That you're gonna point and aim
If you joined a gang, your shit isn't goin' to bang
You're just boring, lame and more the same
You have an enormous chain, but a storm-less brain
The most you could form is rain
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
So, bitch, quit lyin', your denyin' like Mr Porter's name
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter
Fire motor, rounds I told to every iota or I load up
I owe to my motor, mouth
This is my note to self
Sometimes you're gonna bomb
So you might just have to blow yourself up with no one's help

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Te dijo te amo

El dijo que te ama"
288,"If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move
It seems to me is what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seem to me is what you're like
The ""look but please don't touch me"" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

And I'm right by your side

And I love it 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it’s time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn’t always, will be your pill re-
Fill and I’ll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don’t fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills just the effects of each
Other but we gon' film 'cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?) that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me

I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?

But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time, bullshit
What your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you’ll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me
But at night, if you seek those thrills what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only f*ck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge
Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me

Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the f*ck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists to his bones
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it off like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-up valve
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about
'Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is delegation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
An accusation, I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
'Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
'Cause I am

Phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal"

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known

Slim whip, Westside, and Conway are not playin'
I cock back, aim, and I spray you like (boom)"
335,"I ran from my house
That cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me
Even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops
I ran to the sky
Out to the lake
Into the rain
That matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and ran
I was looking for me
I ran past the churches
And the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards
And the lady that never talks
Up into the hills
I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath
And thought about your death
I ran to the lake
Up into the hills
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All the forgotten names
I tasted the rain
I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels
I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
The black sky opened up
Blinding me

I ran to the forest
I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran
I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes
And up to the hill
I ran and I ran
I'm looking there still
And I smelt her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay

I ran and I ran
I'm still running away"
205,"Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter

Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when

When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan

This time I'm not only getting
I'm holding my man"
451,"I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned, 'till then
It will burn inside of me"
65,"Ah yeah, yo! 
This song is dedicated to all the happy people 
All the happy people 
That have real nice lives 

That have now idea what's it like to be broke as f*** 
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope 
Without a circus net 
I'm popping Percocet
I'm a nervous wreck 
I deserve respect 
But I'm working sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tec at somebody to reverse this debt 
Minimum wage got my adrenaline cave 
Pull the venom in rage 
Especially when I'm engaged 
And my daughters down to her last dipper 
That's got my a** hyper 
I prayed to god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer 
Watching ballers well they flossing and pathfinders 
These overnight stars become autograph signers 
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us 
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters 
Well Player haters turn a b**** like they have vagina's 
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us 
Money will brainwash and leave your a** minus 
Snakes slither in the gra** spine less 

[Chorus: x2]
That's rock bottom 
When this life makes you mad enough to kill 
That's rock bottom 
When you want something bad enough to steal 
That's rock bottom 
When you feel you have had it up to hear 
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
 
My life is full of empty promises 
And broken dreams 
I'm hopin' things look up 
But there ain't no job openings 
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, un-furnished 
I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay 
Tired of being hired and fired on the same day 
But f*** it, you know the rules to the game, play 
Cause when we die we know were all going the same way 
It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
All you need is bucks to be the man
plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in the six 
They threw me in the mix 
With all these gloomy loony lunatics 
Walk around impressed 
And smoke a pound of sess a day 
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was yesterday 
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play 
Life half my life and throw the rest away 

[Chorus: x2]

There's people that love me and people that hate me 
But its the evil that made me this backstabber M-C called Slim Shady 
I want the money, the woman, the fortune, the fame 
Means I ain't burning in hell scorching in flames 
Means I m stealing your checkbook and forging your name 
This lifetime lives for eternal torture and pain 
Cause right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom 
I got problems and now everybody on my block's got 'em 
I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em 
Holding two glocks, I hope your door got new locks on 'em 
My daughters feet ain't got no shoe's or sock's on 'em 
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rock's on 'em 
While you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them 
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em? 
Cause I never went gold off one song 
I'm running up on someones lawn with guns drawn 

[Chorus: x2]"
403,"Move your body
Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin'
But I just wanna give you more
Don't care bout nothin'
I'm fallin' for your love in the worst way

So move closer
I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And groove around the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's do ourselves to the world

Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on

In our zone
Do you wanna take it further
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep runnin' this race

I'm so into you...
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight

There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

Oh mother, why aren't you here with me
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up

I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away

They couldn't take my loneliness
I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work
I used to think he was a jerk

I didn't know his heart was broken
And not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of

I made a vow that I would never need
Another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage
A victim of a kind of rage

(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
(I gotta give it up)
I gotta give it up

Closed casket flow, all you niggas get deaded
They don't give you one single rose while you can smell it

P is the second coming of God something to witness
Piece of shit fly on your head like Mike Pence's
We in the trenches
I'm mad, better yet, I'm on a rampage
My people can't even get minimum wage
F*ck a stimulus (uh)
Give me some interest (uh)
Give me a loan
Give me a home
Get me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome
Best wishes, ghost 'em like he Tommy
Ain't worried bout nothin' 'cause Hit Squad behind me

I let it go for the family, meetin's at Cote in Miami
Them wine bottles on maggie, extra large
Sign up for my masterclass, Escobar
Feet up at Mets Stadium at my restaurant (yerr)
Tied in from AZ to Dave East, you know my thoughts get crazy
My teachers, they couldn't grade me
I know some Haitians in Dade County, got choppers in Haiti
She booked a flight to Colombia, made her body amazin'
Just to post it on Tumblr, this that ""f*ck up the summer"" shit
I don't care what you comin' with, me and Hit-Boy runnin' shit (runnin' shit)
Big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (yeah, flooded now)
Pull up with the Ghost like a haunted house (haunted house)
Shit gettin' scary, blood on my hands like Carrie
Might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
I said it was dead, but it faked its death like Machiavelli
You see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti

Yeah, ready?
EPMD, we're back in business (what?)
Livin' in cramped conditions, we'll give you ammunition
Stock them shelves, I got more shells like Taco Bell and I'm not gon' fail
I got no L's like Christmas, you don't wanna make the claws come out (nah)
Y'all should call yourselves Santa (why?) 'Cause none of y'all are real (nah)
Not a single one (like what?), Like a dollar bill (yeah)
It's like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill
We got her a bond and she'll
Never bail on me, not even outta jail
EPMD, but me, I gots no chills (you gotsa chill)
Just a lotta skrill
Lady, my paper's so crazy, I just tossed a mil' out the window
Of my mobile on the fuckin' freeway on the way here (yeah)
Like Rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
That's a lot of bucks flyin' when I'm makin' it rain, dear
Green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
A pocket full of pills, some are Tylenol 3s, prolly two or three Molly

Poverty at it's peak, OCD and PTSD I guess
R.I.P. out to DMX, Stezo, E and Nipsey
Ecstasy and Prince Markie Dee, MF DOOM, I hit 50 via text
Told him that I love him 'cause I don't even know when I'ma see him next (nah)
Tomorrow could be your death (yeah, what?) (Bring that beat back)
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'Cause the brain's iller trained, killer, danger, deranged
And I drank all the DayQuil, I blank on the paper

Hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
I just pray for the day when I'm able to say that I'm placed
With the greats and my name's with the Kane's and the Wayne's and the Jay's
And the Dre's and the Ye's and the Drake's and the J Dilla's, Jada's, Cool J's
And the Ra's and amazin' as Nas is, and praise to the Gods of this

138,"(Ricky Racks)
For what it's worth
You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd f*ck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk

Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with, but this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?

Probably 'cause I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, fight, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder, I'm the only one you'll find
To put up with your shit, I need a plumber line
But nothing comes to mind besides the number 90
'Cause since '06, you flipped my fucking life upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows
Make it rain upwards, we're on that ninth cloud
Two insane lovebirds, I should fly south
'Cause man, am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, ""F*ck it,"" cry our eyes out

Then I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax, then dump your ass in the bathtub
Yeah, now that's love
May sound pathetic, but f*ck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane 'bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending would be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we're not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a fifty cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner see, addiction is a disease

I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul

I will raise you from the ground

And surrender to me

Do you like to boogie-woogie'
Do you like my acid rock'

don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock

Touches everything I'm in, got to have it everyday

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby ""The

Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
Adhd, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (ayy, ayy)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster (ayy)
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em, ""Lick the balls""
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster (ayy)

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake) yeah
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
Or being the recievin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hunnid percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet

So it sucked to hand him his ass, but
Yeah, lookin' back on my feuds
How me and Ja Rule almost got cool
'Cause we shot pool back in '01
Was it '02? I don't know, but
Something told me fuckin' not to
Then we got stuck in high school
I shoved an Oscar up his wazoo

Yeah, but I think of the rappers I slayed and buried like every night
And every career I might've killed, sometimes I say a prayer and I
Wonder is there a heaven for a G? And if so, is the sanctuary nice?
Studios for rap like Coolio, shootin' craps at gangster's paradise

Huh, here a mic, there a mic
Everywhere a mic, share and share alike
But just don't compare alike
Instead of comparin' me, pick a fair fight
Compare me to lightnin', that similarity's strikin'
Compare me to Jaws
Compare me to Manson, Marilyn or Charles
Compare me to Nas, Biggie, or Pac
Do not compare me to that Iggy bitch
Or all this fuckin' Milli Vanilli hip-hop
This is where all that silly shit stops
Compare me to the pistol that triggered this thought
The semi, the Glock, 9 millis get cocked
I'm sending a shot
Don't come around with them floss raps tryna stunt
Compare me to Meek, big wheelies get popped
One by one, compare 'em to scabs, I'm picking them off
They're going home to f*ck Nicki Minaj, aw
Compare me to Diggity-Das, yah
I'm hickity-hitting it raw, ha

In the trailer park (haha)
Told her I'd play the part like Kanan Stark's
Ate her twat like a Tater Tot, oh shit
Get the strap like a trainin' bra

Goin' at these pricks like Lorena Bobbitt
Y'all want drama, we can make a scary movie like Marlon Wayans

Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK)
We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
Oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided
to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the
baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls
""Like I'm just checking on you dog""
While I throw up this message on the star

[Chorus]
When them bottles stop poppin'
And them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and dont stop (dont stop)
I made a promise to my momma
I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)

I'm living proof nigga
Its pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
Its the Worldwide American way
I'm living proof nigga

Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
Tell em where to shove it straight up (?)
F*ck it,
The last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophy it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
Shit, the day that I dont straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
Without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
Cause I'll be screaming on these horns till I'm hoarse!

Nah I aint fading yet
I'd rather stay and rap
I mighta made a deck
I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
So I dont stay in debt
Me broke
You might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
With AK's with baby bayonet's
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
Thats why its either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homocide Ryan

Theres a bomb inside my head
I'ma live wire, I am on the edge
Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
Get on a nut like a tyre iron
I have no desire stopping so why would I drop and roll
Thats how much I'm flying higher (?)
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flying by 'em
Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up
So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up

So pop the hood and see what's good I need to a toolin' man
My precious love I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thumpin' on the lot

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

Stuck to the seat our body heat, what will you do with those ice
This should get outta here, was steppin' on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're gone past, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

I'll work on the engine
Like we blew a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

I hear you work in a body shop
I hear you work in a body shop

I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die it's true

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on the line

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like

10,"Yo, how do I keep
(I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Getting in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says something about me
(Yeah)
Should I look in the mirror?

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal

And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, told her why I'm soulless, she's

Heartless, no wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger

She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun'
We over but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the f*ck did I get so twisted?
I picked someone that's so unlikable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seein'
She's only mine for the time bein'
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!

I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hoppin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the f*ck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo
Flip me off right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?
Yeah, I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?"
260,"Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom

You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
And I'm no longer needed

You sad I was over wanted it to end
Than you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking
And I'm the last to know

Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak city
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
You never gained the best of me
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me
'Cause I'm in heartbreak city

You tore me into pieces
You didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess

I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

You sad I was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends

You had a few secrets
I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

I'm in the middle of hearbreak city
Now I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
I'm in the middle of heartbreak city
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty
You never gained the best of me
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me
'Cause I'm in heartbreak city

And it's not that pretty
And it still feels shity"
221,"Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away

I've been swimming in the ocean
""Til I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide 
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

Oh, save my 
Oh, save my 
Oh, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Oh, save my
Oh, save my 
Oh, save my 
Devil's here to fool ya

Oh, save my
Oh save my 
Oh, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Oh, save my 
Oh, save my
Oh, save my
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary can't you help me
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home

Yeah we can run and we can hide 
But we won't find the answers
If you go down then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul
Then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

Oh, sing hallelujah
Oh, save my soul
Oh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said oh, sing hallelujah
Oh, save my soul
Oh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told 

Until my story's told"
57,"Meet eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
(""s*** is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this"")

Alright, stop! (huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (but who are you?)
I'm your motherf***in conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than george burns

F*** that! do that s***! shoot that b****!
Can you afford to blow this s***? are you that rich?
Why you give a f*** if she dies? are you that b****?
Do you really think she gives a f*** if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!	(you're right!)
Not over this s*** (stop!) drop the biscuit (i will!)
Don't even listen to slim yo, he's bad for you
(you know what dre? I don't like your attitude..)

(""It's alright see'mon, just come in here for a minute"")
(""I don't know!"")
(""Look baby.."")
(""Damn!"")
(""Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?"")
(""Well ok.."")

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (""give me a kiss!"")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play... (""s***!"")

Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
And smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little b****'s earlobe..
(Yo! this girl's only fifteen years old

You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair? (uh huh!)
F*** this b**** right here on the spot bare
'Til she pa**es out and she forgot how she got there

(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _kids_?)
No, but I seen the porno with sundoobiest!
(s***, you want to get hauled off to jail?)
Man f*** that, hit that s*** raw dawg and bail..

Meet grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.

(""What the f***?!?!"")
(""Grady!!"")

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

F*** that s***, you just caught this b**** cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
F*** slittin her throat, cut this b****'s head off!!!

Wait! what if there's an explanation for this s***?
(what? she tripped? fell? landed on his dick?!)
Alright shady, maybe he's right grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Okay! thought about it, still want to stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes??!

What'chu say? (what's wrong?	 didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherf***er!

Uhhh-aahh! temper temper!
Mr. dre? mr. n.w.a.?
Mr. ak comin' straight outta compton why'all better make way?
How in the f*** you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw f*** it...

37,"Wanna take it from the top?

Lady you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you can set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you I actually said to myself, ""I gotta meet her like a taxi""
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
You sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camero
I'm tryin' to catch up, I'm tryna' jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the meow, hope it's not a problem in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this bomb in your cap
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it 100, like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following back
About six cars, I'm in the Lak
And I want to

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the connivence store
But those jeans you wore, I've never seen before
I pretend to work there, while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
Pull up behind you while you're leaving and you don't even know it (yo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror, she's rapping my shit
But she wasn't aware, I was there, or maybe she was, and just did't care
Who knows, at least that ain't up in the air
It's something to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't planning to do shit, this summers eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But f*ck the Pepe Le Pu shit
""Ain't stepping to you bitch"", I say to myself
Plus she's bumping my music, and chasing no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her, to some degree
And f*ck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
F*ck it, pull up beside her
Side swipe her, Dodge Viper
Wood is upright I asked if she wants a computer lodged up her vagina
Said my dick is an Apple
She said ""put it inside her""
I said

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
'Cause it just died like ""ooh, food coloring, duh""
So let's get turnt, like a shish kebob, twist it Ma
Like an air conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water, I bet you get yourself a steam
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner
You got puns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of Ds
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred me in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too, look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle finger, to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you saw you're on fire
Me too, you're burning up, I'm want it

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

Under ones and twos, to three or four in the morning
Rick's for the cut like Neosporin (what)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand

Who the f*ck, it's my big dick, so everybody get ready right fucking now"

Just like an animal, down on my knees

Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

I'm in my bed, and I'm obsessed
I'm lying wide awake
I need someone like you to come
And put me in my place

Boy, you don't wanna know
But in the night, my hands are tied
You tell me where to go

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him ‘cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin' shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catchin'
A good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken

The New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it

Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yo)

In faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer

Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live 20 miles away (fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the f*ck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

You little groupie bitch, get off me, go f*ck Puffy!
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the f*ck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Um, here, ""XXL! XXL!""

Nobody ever gave a f*ck before
All they did was doubt me (Did was doubt me)

I can't keep on waiting for you

Don't cry for me

Night is getting colder  sometimes
Life feels like it's a curse

Don't want to carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Children killing children while the
Students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't want to carry anymore

We're gonna swim to the ocean floor
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor

Wash away all our sins

Sometimes I want to tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

And I know that love will change us forever

75,"Man, whatever
Dre just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone
F*ck it, just shut up and listen, ayo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this—on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a f*ck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am"

How can life be what you want it to be

You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mm, if I could melt your heart
Mm, we'd never be apart
Mm, give yourself to me
Mm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

104,"I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light"

Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again

Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few

If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded

I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo

'Cause I keep peakin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud, but it's almost as though
I don't hear no sound, I should get ready for the show now
Wait is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax and just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack, you can't murder a show nobody's at
But what if nobody shows?
Panic mode 'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show, just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
The press is 'bout to go apeshit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, 'nother Valium fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the Scope

Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supplies infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of 'em John Travolta, stayin' alive by inches

Cops are knockin', oh, f*ck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over, no suicide note
Just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked

But death is turning, so definite, wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm trying to rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, f*ck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin', now I know"
201,"Should have left you standing right where you stood
Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie, I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

(Nowhere to hide)
(No place to run)
(Nowhere to hide)
(No place to run)"
296,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

Words, they cut like a knife

I don't want to hear your words

Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know

Your words

You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your (words)
Words, words

A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation (words)
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information (I've grown tired of your words)
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words"
139,"I could be with anybody, I choose you
Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd used you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""
Next I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up
Then I got you totally open as soon as I take your top off
You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
My friends say you're bad for me, hogwash

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back

Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in Saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the f*ck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
You used to always have my back

So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality, somehow it seems like
When I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep, you're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my Valium, I'm an addict you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiends how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G-O-D
I thought you loved me, but you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
F*ck all you

Fuckin' bitch
We're done"

Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide

Yeah, 03, I went from plain filthy to filthy rich
Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick

I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid

Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it three A.M. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again

Nowhere to run and hide

441,"Once upon a time I had plenty of nothing,
Which was fine with me.
Because I had rhythm, music, love,
The sun, the stars and the moon above,
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea.
That was when the best things in life were free.

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty,
Which is fine with me.
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm,
But look at what I got to go with 'em.
""Who could ask for anything more?"", I hear you query.
Who would ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie.

Got my diamonds, got my yacht, got a guy I adore.
I'm so happy with what I got, I want more!

Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score.
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician, all I know is addition
I find counting a bore.
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting.
[More! More!]

I got rhythm, music too, just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue,
Now, however, I own the view.
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more.

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four,
And if you like four, why not a few
Why not a slew
[More! More!]

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle.
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle.
[More! More!]

Never say when, never stop at plenty,
If it's gonna rain, let it pour.
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny, wouldn't you like many much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard, remember Mother Hubbard.
[More! More!]

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar.
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less.
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more more
[Except all, all, all]
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all [have it all]
You may find all else above [find all else above]
That though things are bliss,
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!"
310,"I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back I'd have no fear
If I took another path
Things would be so different, but they're not

I could have just kept my big mouth closed
I could have just done what I was told
Maybe I should have turned silver into gold
But in front of you
I was cold

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
Do you wanna know how to make out loud
Telling your plans

We coulda bought a house with a swimming pool
Fill it up with Warhols
It would be so cool
Coulda gone buyin' estates in the countryside
With a pack of great things
Kissing eye to eye
We coulda do the world in a private jet
Run naked on the beach all soaking wet
We coulda found a mountain seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We coulda got a building built on the echo run
We coulda got ourselves arrested and sold our mum
We coulda live like crazy til' the day we die
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry
Je suis desole
I wish I could take you back but I can't

I fucked up
I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry
I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back,
Maybe one day,
Or not"
446,"All work and no play,
Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

Chorus:

You're a man with a gun in your hand,
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

(chorus)

All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, I would never let you go.

(chorus, with last line:)
'Cause I can show you some fun

(spoken) And I don't mean with a gun. No.

You are a man with a gun in your hand;
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't take time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun, take it out of your hand;

Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.
If you don't make time, it's not nice,
So here's my advice:
Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one."
429,"Girls can wear jeans, cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots 'cause it's okay to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading

But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl

For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world
For a girl in this world

Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world for a girl
Do you know what it feels like for a girl
Do you know what it feels like in this world

328,"When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one

Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one

I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light

You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you (Everything I give you)
All comes back to me

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

311,"When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I’d kept at bay
A hairline break that’s taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure so sure I’d struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark

See our hearts are intertwined
Then I’m free, free of mine
I’m falling free

And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love

And when you lift you raise the sail
And then I’m free, free to fail
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over Hope and Love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again

When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, free to go
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

I’m falling
I’m falling
I’m falling free

Deep and pure our hearts align
And then I’m free, I’m free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we’re both free, we’re free to go

Let me holla at you
(D.A. got that dope)
It's one of those kinda nights

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' a cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the Motel 8
Yeah, Bizzare's tryna get a lapdance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like, ""Goddamn""
She's like, ""That's harassment""
I'm like, ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a Bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy
She said, ""F*ck off"", and threw her liquor at me
(It's one of those kinda nights)
(Then I said, I said)

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights

This beat keeps takin' me back, like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God, my whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on?"" Ah (haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?"", I said, ""No, I'm high""
I'm checkin' out the chick, she said, ""So am I""
What's in the cup? Let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise

O-M-G
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Says she wants go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot
Here comes the brigade
Turnt like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay, me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over""
She said, ""No problemo"", windows are dark tint
Roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're hoein'
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no-one
I'm high and you're bi
I'm comin', you're going

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah

But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)

(Say can I take you home, where we can be alone?)
Shawty, you the shit
Girl, I order you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides ya (I love)
Like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides, hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl, you're so fucking fly
You belong in the mile high club
So come on baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high strung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' for, we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing' a light bulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim, and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda
But

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I sing, I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)"

Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm

86,"America! We love you! 
How many people are proud 
to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours? 
The stripes and the stars for the rights 
that men have died for to protect 
The women and men who have broke their necks 
for the freedom of speech 
The United States government has sworn to uphold. 
(Yo I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) 
or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, 
So many motherf***in' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs, 
It's like a f***in' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed 
in no particular direction, 
Just sprays and sprays 
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays, 
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought, 
standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide, 
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear 
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? 
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office, 
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, 
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled s*** all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

[Chorus]
White America! 
I could be one of your kids,
white America!
little Eric looks just like this,
White America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get, 
white America!
I Could be one of your kids, 
white America!
little Eric looks just like this, 
white America!
Erica loves my s***,
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like ya'self
If they were brown
Shady lose 
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so f*** school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the f***in' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a f*** I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like ""F*** it""
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his a**
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this s*** wow
I'm like ""My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?""

[Chorus]

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthaf***in' turbulance
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like 
""I dont like this, no!""
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a b**** and say fagot
S***,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthaf***in' spokesman now for

[Chorus]

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
F*** you Ms. Cheney
F*** you tipper Gore
F*** you with the freeness of speech this 
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
F*** you!

Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you"

Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to f*ck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound

Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels mammals and rabbits

Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh

And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him

My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before

With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore

94,"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so f*ck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a f*ck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And f*ck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that f*ck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
298,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"

Round and round

But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I don't know why this world keep turning 
(When someone wants to test us when someone tries our patience)
Round and round 
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now 

I hang with a bunch of hippies 
And wacky tobacco planters 
Who swallow lit roaches 
And light up like jack-o-lanterns 
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts 
'cause we're dope as f*** and only get a two in the source 
They never should've booted me out of reform school 
Deformed fool, takin' a s***, in the warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn 
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!) 
It all started when my mother took my bike away 
'cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave 
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers 
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors 
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman 
F*** the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin' 
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead, 
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed 
May be true, till I told this b**** in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who me?) 
Yeah b**** you so big 
You walked into Big Panties and stepped on Jenny Craig 
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig 
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig 
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (rar!) 
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming 
Grabbed that b**** by her hair 
Drug her across the ground 
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down 
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop 
While I drop this b**** face down and watch her belly flop

Round and round

While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards 
Outsiders, and we suing the courts 
'Cause we dope as f*** and only get a two in The Source 
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat 
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blonds be at 
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage 
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park b**** 
I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya"" 
I'd like to treat ya to a bagel and a slice of pizza 
But I'm broke as f*** and I don't get paid till the first of next month 
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt 
But I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers 
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist 
So gimme all your money 
And don't try nothin' funny 
'Cause you know your stinkin' a** is too fat to try to outrun me 
I went to grab my gun 
That's when her a** put it on me 
Wit' an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry 
I fell through the glass doors 
Started causin' a scene 
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine 
Jumped up with a broken back 
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day 
And doped up off coke and smack 
All I wanted to do was rape the b**** and snatch her purse 
Now I want to kill her 
But so I gotta catch her first 
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut 
Saw the house she ran up in 
And shot her f***in' porch up 
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut 
Looked around the room 
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut 
I know you're in there b****! I got my gun c***ed! 
You might as well come out now 
She said ""Come in, its unlocked!"" 
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne 
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn 
She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"" 
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it 
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her 
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her 
I started to beg ""No, please let go"" 
But she swallowed my f***in' leg whole like an egg roll 
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled 
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple 
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick 
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick! 
Whipped that s*** out, and ain't no doubt about it 
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage 
I shouted ""Now b****, lets see who gets the best!"" 
Stuffed that s*** in crooked and f***ed that fat slut to death (Ah! ah!) 

Come here b****! 
Come here! 
Take this motherf***in' dick! 
B****, come here! 

I don't know why this world keep turning

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways

You've been through a lot
I tell you stories some times you know

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize, my every single move
But then I realized, I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise, when I became the news

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark

I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

(Talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say your little prayer
Had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a f*ck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two 
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybpdy
And trapster, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messaiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless, like a renegade
I had a feeling, that I can't explain
I didn't listen, to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant, as a northern star
I had a fire, burning in my heart
I never gave up, fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered
I came I saw I conquered

I conquered
I conquered
I conquered"
448,"I have a tale to tell

I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again

Have you ever been hit so hard
That it sends your body flying across the room
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge, isn't it?

I've always lived in my own world, I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside he loved me

It was a time I suffered so much
I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms, not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this earth

I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain
That was eating me inside, nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and it invades me

I believe we are messengers on earth
I believe in Angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much
To become who I am today

Now you have to realize not only do I have a family
But now I have a whole hood and that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang, I just wanted to fit in

But one day I was forced to do something
That made me open my eyes and realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up

Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said you know what to do really, it's time to get poppy for the hood

That was not to kill anybody"
82,"Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again
I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?!
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the f*ck up! (You're drunk!
You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a f*ck?!
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me, Kim! You really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a -year-old little 
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me!
What the f*ck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
F*ck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the f*ck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the f*ck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the f*ck could you do this to me?!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!
Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!
Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!) F*ck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
Oh my God, I'm crackin' up, get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!) So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only makin' this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah, somebody help!""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the f*ck up and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you"
445,"High flying, adored
So young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
You were just a backstreet girl
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting

High flying, adored
Did you believe in your wildest moments
All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?

Were there stars in your eyes
When you crawled in at night
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall

High flying, adored
What happens now, where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you

High flying, adored
I hope you come to terms with boredom
So famous so easily, so soon
It's not the wisest thing to be

You won't care if they love you
It's been done before
You'll despair if they hate you
You'll be drained of all energy
All the young who've made it would agree

High flying, adored
That's good to hear but unimportant
My story's quite usual
Local girl makes good, weds famous man
I was stuck in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap, I was lucky
But one thing I'll say for me
No one else can fill it like I can"

As the title of the album suggests
This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being done in

Like the shade in these windows
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
But no way they can see in though (nah)
OJ blade is a pencil (yeah)
Propane takin' my cranium

No, huge man chin, new Manson, loose cannon
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
The kinda crazy you can't fix
I'm still the one your parents hate
I'm in your house eatin' carrot cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I'm irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight
Into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Dre's on concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it's a staircase

Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go

Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe

Stop dwelling, then stop yelling
I'm not yelling, you're yelling
Smart-aleck, goddammit
F*ck is that? Stop hammering (Goddamn)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics'll get slain
Like they were strangled with bicycle chains
You're gonna have to come identify the remains, wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie (yup)
Can't get a fuckin' word in edgewise (shut up)
Success overnight like a red eye (bitch)
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm hot, dawg, no you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Chick ran up like, ""Marshall, on fire""
I looked down and said, ""No, I'm not, you're a liar""
She said, ""No, your music
Heard you're back with the Doctor,"" then I heard

54,"I get to busting like I'm a thirty ought six
When I'm ripping the beat up, but then I heard he got pissed
When I got at the top and they made him pretty hot
'Cause he knowin that Tecca Ninna's a dirty chopper
He's handle, holmes, here's a handful
How in the hell he hovering having hella go H.A.M. Though?
I said to Seven, ""Richard Havens'll be the man""
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, ""what we doin'?,"" I said to I'm, let's chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling, you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I've got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em melt
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turning up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton makin ‘em be impotent
If and when I be flipping niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pimp a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm living in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than you figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em 'til they be gone feed 'em

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstasy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbing a mic and babbling, I dabble in the Vic's
But I might just swallow my fucking Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbing it right from the medicine cabinet
'Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
All this anger pent up inside
I went up inside a Bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That'll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up being
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy's wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous
And I'm as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
You've been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I'm the genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll be
Just like a certificate of authenticity

That I'm thinkin' about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I'm picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it's my job to say
That you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna f*ck with the.

I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who's having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
'Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it

438,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

They were singing
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die"
71,"When I was just a little baby boy
My Mama used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my Daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These motherfuckers are thinkin', I'm playin'
Thinkin I'm sayin' this shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?

Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You god damn right bitch and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
F*ck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't 'Acid Rap' but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again

You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth
Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal' ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
(Why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Know why I say these things?
'Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
F*ck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
F*ck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor

From in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Till I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet
I said, ""Shut up"", when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me

Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna f*ck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nuttin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me
Bitch I'ma kill you!
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""
I said, ""You don't, wanna f*ck with Shady
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you""

Freaky tales (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking, but I wanna stick her like she decals
But when murdering females, better pay attention to these details
Or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a f*ck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities bursting outta me, please, beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs""
Chop her up, put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's trailer
And leave 'em there

But, hey, man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew something was wrong
Think I'm becoming monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But, dog, how the f*ck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it, to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond
'Cause it's incumbent upon
Me, plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl
The motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collecting newspaper articles, cutting up seconds from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper cut my public defender's
Jugular, then stuck up in the blender
Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

But, hey, man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please give me one minute

I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty

How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what, it's nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap looking like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen, for raping eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked when I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen, I lay in wait, adjacent facing the door remaining patient
While staying complacent, blatant 
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow, in hopes that when you get home
You'll get the hint ho, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me
I could describe a murder scene in a verse
And be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly 
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary

No officer, you see I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers, please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody, I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?

Crazy for you, baby"
472,"Some nights, all alone
Thoughts of you come creepin' in
Temporarily insane
Cause you're never gonna change, no

We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame, I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy it's time to move on

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

We had, we had, we had, we had
(Are you listening?)
We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought, we'd be happily forever

I'd always thought (what you want her to do?) now here I am
I'd always thought (why can't you listen?) we'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway

Check it out, nigga, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Nigga, I need, we could fight with 'em, ride
Yeah, uh, yeah

Done seen some shit within my lifetime, my light shine bright
Protect yo' energy from poison when the python strike
My first mistake was doin' robberies on Nikon bikes
Watch my moves and I'ma show you what a icon like
Y'all let bygones be bygones, right?
Nigga, f*ck yo' truce, bust yo' move
And if that nigga touch your shoes
You better blast on 'em and on my mama, nigga
I'ma get that cash on 'em, hunnid on the dash on 'em
Swerve, born from the trench, you from the 'burbs
Nigga, f*ck the early bird, nigga
I'ma get this motherfuckin' chicken
And if a nigga ever got a problem, nigga
We can fuckin' solve it, on my mama, nigga
I just been itchin' to prove myself
I just pray throughout the struggle I don't lose myself
Glock, no safety, Plaxico, I might shoot myself
They catchin' bullets like two Odells, and, nigga, you gon' tell
But listen

I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

First and foremost, for every door that's opened, a door close
Beat a nigga, take his Bordeauxs, upgrade my wardrobe
And Lord knows livin' like this, it leads a short road
A dead end, or prison time, where we was headin'
Instead, when I got bread, broke it with brethren
Eyes open, leave the house, move like a veteran
Made a couple dollars from come-ups, my niggas flexin'
Nigga got a problem, then I can make some corrections
Okay, cool, still with the same niggas since grade school
Give a f*ck about your Shade Room when I had made room
For everybody on that late moon, and word to Rae Sremm'
Had to bring the motherfuckin' swank on 'em
And I ain't even wanna have to blank on 'em
That Lamb' truck got a full tank on 'em
But, a nigga better not look at me wrong
It's certain shit that I can't say on this song, but let me tell you, nigga

I can tell you 'bout the time was goin' hard up in the paint
And I can tell you shit that other niggas can't, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had to drop a nigga rank
And I can tell you shit I did up off the drank, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I signed a deal for twenty bands
And used that shit to get my brother out the can, lemme tell you
I can tell you 'bout the time I had a penny and a plan (yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can tell you shit, but you won't understand, lemme tell you, nigga

I done seen some shit within my lifetime, at one time I
Can still remember just how bad I used to want five mics
My biggest dream was just to make it into Unsigned Hype (word)
It's so hard for me to fathom this was once my life (yeah)
Shit'll make you wanna cop out like a plea deal (yeah)
So I treat a beat like it's Tekashi, spit on that bitch like Meek Mill
My addiction got me weak-willed (yup)
I'm relapsing, I think I can't seem to stop eating Beat Pills
And Doctor D-R-E he still keeps on givin' me refills
Send 'em at me, bullets hit indiscriminately
Women and men and little kids senior citizens 'til the Sig is empty
Whipped Gen-Z into a frenzy, but no gift, is in me, I'm stingy
And that is the motherfuckin' difference between them and me (who?)
And that's the reason I'm, in my Louis Vuitton (what am I?)
Gorier than Eva Long (yeah)
This rap shit, is somethin' that you'll never see me at 
Like senior prom (wait a minute what I mean)
What I mean's the bar's, higher than Cheech and Chong (yeah, wow)
When you give them each a bong (yeah)
I call my stan's a, fan club 'cause whoever it's unleashed upon (what?)
Fuckin' beats up on (bitch), like police batons (y'all are)
Y'all are window shoppers, bunch a Peeping Toms
Still got that bullseye on my back (back), red dot on my head (yeah)
Yeah, blood on my hands for some of the rhymes that I've said (why?)
Police squad on the task
Got 'em hot on my trail, like my stepfather with the belt, I got S.W.A.T. on my ass
I was painfully shy, now I'm proud of myself
Like Obama's kids, I came outta my shell (Michelle)
And I can promise this
On my mama, shit, no daughters, bitch (here we go now)
Yeah, every single word'll be true so with out further adieu
It's return of the ruthless more murderous than Mook is 
So what you're gonna do's think I'm allergic 
When I point this motherfuckin burner at 'chu (ah-choo)
I throw shade it'll be curtains for you
Pray for the verse to get through, birth of a new (yeah)
Worser me, who's determined to do
Permanent damage with the words that I threw 
Bird's-eye view I'm referred to as Zeus
Circlin' you like I'm a vulture features are tournaments, I turn 'em into
Turnin' me loose is like verbal abuse, language hurtful to use cursin' at you
Made a couple of mistakes that occurred in my youth 
Jumped a hurdle or two, word but I'm through
With tellin' you about the food stamps and the government cheese
And how we used to get school lunches for free
Already told ya, 'bout the holes up in my Pony shoes and Rustler jeans
When it was Mother, lil' brother and me
I told you 'bout, being kicked out 20 degrees, no money to eat (yeah)
'Bout the thrift stores and being piss poor 
The Christmases Ma had gifts for us, when bro and me discovered that she
Was wrappin' shit up around the house, to stick it under the tree
Damn"

What'd I fuckin' tell you about turnin' off the lights? (What, what? I didn't do it)

Don't you fuckin' lie, you little fucker (no)
Don't you fuckin' lie to me (stop)"
45,"On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Holy whack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin' right!
To the rap mobile, let's go!

Marshall! Marshall!

Bitches and Gentleman!
It's showtime!
Hurry, hurry, step right up!
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is

Marshall!

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you

Marshall!

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business

Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?
Hell Yeah!

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

So there you have it folks
Marshall!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because
Marshall!
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and gray
Marshall!
So until next time friends
Same blond hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
Marshall!
Oh! Ha!"

When you see her, say a prayer and kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can'

Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl
Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl

You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazon es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl
Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl

Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now

Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
He's spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl
Quien es esa nina, who's that girl
Senorita, mas fina, who's that girl

Light up my life, so blind I can't see

319,"Little girl don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

Little girl never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try, it's not the same

Keep your head held high, ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

Little girl don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss, kiss her goodbye

Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

I fought to be so strong, I guess you knew
I was afraid you'd go away, too

Little girl you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try, but it feels like a lie

Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on, but I'm doing it wrong
Can't kiss her goodbye, but I promise to try"

This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all

Certainties disappear
What do we do? For our dream to survive?
How do we keep, all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away

The one you said I could do without

Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December first, nineteen ninety-five, Dear Hallie)

You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me but as long as you’re healthy
That’s all that matters for the time being but obviously
Assuming you will be, just thinking ahead
I'ma make it if it kills me, let’s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
I'm sorry for sloppy writing, the pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me
Dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm 
As I'm using in this letter maybe they can fuel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world
Love, daddy
Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

I built this castle

I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December first, nineteen ninety-six) 

Dear Hallie
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile 
but you ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, lil' minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em baby
I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios while I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far
I just keep steering I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My infinite CD flock, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something
Ooh, I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I built this castle 
Now we are trapped on the throne
I’m sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I’m gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you
I'm prepared to do whatever, to do whatever (December twenty-fourth, two thousand and seven)

Dear Hallie
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between 'em since I rise to this fame
I said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you 
but dang, I never knew it'd be like this
If I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished fed up with it, I'm hanging it up
F*ck it! Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote 
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy
Love dad
Shit, I don't know"

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

Without a second thought
It all became a silly a game
Some things cannot be bought

I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly

And now I find
I've changed my mind

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

I traveled round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone

I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion"
