No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters push to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again on the back of my hand,
And I know it sounds tragic

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
(I'm addicted to your love)
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It's like MDNA and that's OK

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm ready to take this chance
I need to dance

It feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

This is your life
Children on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messengers, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multi-task
Connecting to the WIFI
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweetin’ on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don’t even feel the pressure

I’m gonna be okay
I don’t care what the people say
I’m gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I’m gonna live right

I’m moving fast can you follow my track?
I’m moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don’t give a

You were so mad at me
Who’s got custody
Lawyers suck it up
Didn’t have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
Ride my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the biters have to go
Standing in the front row

I’m gonna be okay
I don’t care what the people say
I’m gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I’m gonna live right

I’m moving fast can you follow my track?
I’m moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem
I don’t give a

I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself
And I swallowed my light
I tried to become all
That you expect of me
And if it was a failure
I don’t give a

I don’t give a
I don’t give a
I don’t give a
I don’t give a

Shots fire, anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire
You don't hear them bums on nothin', that's fire
Tell 'em, catch fire
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna, Nicki ah say you original Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, Inna all ya Prada
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar
See I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at a Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cuttin' him checks, I was his boss
Yo I don't give a f you, a curse, nor bless you
Never let them stress you.
I ain't a business woman, I'm a business, woman
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman

I’m gonna be okay
I don’t care what the people say
I’m gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I’m gonna live right

I’m moving fast can you follow my track?
I’m moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once

Your love's coming down like
Rain

When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye
Could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

Feel it on my finger tips, hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like

Here comes the sun...here comes the sun
And I say...never go away

Waiting is the hardest thing
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul
That by sheer force of will
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound you'll appear
And surrender to me
To love

Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain

I'll stand out on the mountain top
Until I hear you call
My name

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Thoughts of you come creepin' in
Temporarily insane
Cause you're never gonna change, no

We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame, I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy it's time to move on

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway

Madonna:
Wanna get to know you in a special
Way. This doesn't happen to me
Everyday. Don't try to hide it,
Love wears no disguise. I see the
Fire burning in your eyes. Only
When I'm dancing, can I feel this
Free? At night, I lock the doors
Where no one else can see. I'm
Tired of dancing here all by
Myself. Tonight, I wanna dance
With someone else.

Madonna:
Get into the groove. Let me show you
Some moves. It's best you take it
From me, yeah. Get up on your feet.

Beat ya hard on the track, if you
Know what I mean. Hollywood and New
York, Madonna is the Queen. And
Misdemeanor say, uh! Uh!

There are some who believe that I owe them something
But they're wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself
And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there, I am to blame

Chorus:

Say goodbye to anonymity
I have to [have to, have to] say goodbye
To privacy, but most of all
To innocence (repeat 3 times)

My life is not a game that I play to entertain you
And if you can do it better, then you're welcome to my fame
I'm not gonna waste my time correcting myths and rumors
You believe what you wanna believe

(chorus)

I don't wanna say goodbye
I don't need a reason to cry
Kinda makes me wanna
Kinda makes me hafta

Stop and think about it (repeat 3 times)
Do I want to?

I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting down and up]

I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting up and down]
I don't [getting up and down]

Up-up, d-d-down, up-up-up

Listen up
It always comes down to this (repeat)

Some people have a snake at the base of their spine
That would suck out your life, that would take all your time
They're called feeders
They're not believers but you must not fear it
They're takers

You know you better stop, stop and think about it (repeat 3 times)

Your innocence (repeat 3 times)

I don't wanna say goodbye to innocence
I don't need a reason to cry, innocence

Hold on to your innocence
Hold on [hold on, hold on], hold on to innocence
Hold on

Stop and think about it, say goodbye, think about it (repeat twice)",1
427,revenge,http://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/3952449/Madonna/Revenge,"There is no such thing as revenge
You will not give as good as you got
There is no such thing as an eye for an eye
If you think you're the giver, you're not

There is no such thing as regret
There is no point in placing the blame
Hate destroys the one who hates
And everyone suffers the same

What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go

There is only love and respect
To thine own self be true
When you point the finger
There are three fingers pointing back at you

What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go

Recognize that God is alive in everyone
Recognize that love lives in us all

What you see
Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
And let them go
Let them go
Let them go
Let them go

Is not necessarily what you get
Eyes are the window to the soul
Take your judgements
